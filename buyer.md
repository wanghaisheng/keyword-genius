Types and examples of buyer intent keywords
Traditionally, SEOs sort buyer intent keywords into different groups. This grouping helps clarify differences between the keywords and makes organizing campaigns easier — if you’re new to the topic, this is something worth knowing.

Type	Example Keywords
Transactional. Indicate that the user is ready to make a purchase or take a specific action, such as ordering or subscribing.	order pizza, buy concert tickets, subscribe to fitness magazine
Commercial. Used by users who are researching products or services before making a purchase decision.	best running shoes, high-performance laptops, top eco-friendly cars
Navigational. Used when a user is looking for a specific website or page.	target weekly ad, wikipedia, prime login

Location-based. Used by users looking for businesses, services, or products in a specific geographical area. 	dentist near me, vegan Brighton, co-working spaces in Warsaw
Long-tail. Get a small number of searches per month, tend to be longer and more specific. 	best running shoes for cross country, budget-friendly home office chairs, tips for organic gardening in small spaces



Sort by ascending CPC to get keywords with a higher probability of high intent on top.

And if you want to spy on your competitors paid keywords, you can use Paid keywords report in the same tool.

I have a list of keywords for my website, along with data on search volume, keyword difficulty, and cost per click. I’d like to score these keywords based on four categories: Traffic Potential, Conversion Potential, Keyword Difficulty, and Cost per Click.
