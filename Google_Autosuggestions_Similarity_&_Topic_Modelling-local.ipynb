        "## **SEO Keyword Collection and Analysis Script Guide**\n",
        "\n",
        "This script is designed to collect a broad set of keywords starting from a seed keyword. Keywords are scraped from Google Autosuggest using various techniques, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Alphabet technique**: Appending letters of the alphabet (or numbers 0-9) at different positions of the keyword (beginning, end, between words) to generate variations.\n",
        "- **Asterisk technique**: Using an asterisk as a wildcard to find keyword variations.\n",
        "- **Modifiers**: Incorporating over 200 interrogative and other modifiers to refine and expand the search.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the code execution, you will be prompted to enter the seed keyword, a proxy to ensure safe scraping (use the format http://username:password@host:port) to avoid the risk of Google banning your IP, and you will need to upload the Excel file containing the list of modifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The scraping can be done in a single step or recursively to find even more long-tail keywords, gradually moving away from the relevance of the seed keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output of this phase includes**:\n",
        "- `google_autocomplete_suggestions_output.csv`: This file contains the extracted keywords, organized into columns based on the scraping technique used.\n",
        "- `scraped_seed_keywords_list.csv`: A deduplicated list that merges various lists from the scraping phase. This consolidated list serves as the input for subsequent analyses, including **Semantic Similarity against a Context** and **Topic Modeling**.\n",
        "\n",
        "These outputs provide a comprehensive keyword set, paving the way for deeper analysis focused on identifying semantically relevant keywords and understanding user intent through topic trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Trimming Down Keywords Through Semantic Similarity\n",
        "To make the final list more manageable, a trim down approach based on semantic similarity is applied. The starting point is the seed keyword and two expansion keywords (sub-topics or semantically related keywords that define the main topic but can be lexically distant). The script will use GPT-4 to generate a semantically rich text from these keywords. **The seed and expansion keywords are crucial** as they set the context for the entire analysis. The generated context text is then used to compare against the scraped keyword list from Autosuggest to identify relevant keywords, based on a semantic similarity threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Components of the Script\n",
        "The script uses:\n",
        "- **KMeans** for clustering,\n",
        "- **FastEmbed** for efficient vectorization,\n",
        "- **All-MiniLM-L6-v2** Transformer model for multi-language support.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output and Downloads\n",
        "The lists of clustered keywords and excluded keywords, including their similarity scores, will be accessible for download in Excel format within the newly created 'Output' folder (`clustered_keywords.xlsx` and `excluded_keywords.xlsx`).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Topic Modeling and Insights\n",
        "Additionally, the script performs topic modeling on the scraped keyword list using **LDA with HDBSCAN**. The results, available in both tabular Excel format and graphical formats like word clouds, provide immediate insights into the predominant topics reflected in user searches captured by Google Autosuggest. These topic aggregations serve as a valuable tool for guiding the creation of a content plan or a hub of semantically related articles to cover the topic of interest."
