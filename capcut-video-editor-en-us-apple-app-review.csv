4,Grandmaster Marti,"So, I’m a very beginner editor and was happy to come across capcut seeing as that it was free and had great reviews. I have almost mastered this app completely and don’t want to leave and switch over to something that’s paid when capcut is doing things that every other editing service is doing. However, there is always room to grow, especially for the editors who’s skills are growing faster and wanting more. A few of my recommendations is having more advanced and better options for speed. Please add more filters (specifically in the border area), and add ones that are different and will give our videos good quality(I’m pretty sure y’all can come up with something!). I ask that we get more font options and allow us to use more than 1 animation for out fonts PLEASEE!! Those are just a few of my recommendations. Now, on to my concerns the app does lag a little, and constantly says that I’m out of storage and I delete a lot of previous edits just to make new ones, and I’m getting concerned that the app will just not be enough for me. It’s already taken up most of my storage andI really want it to be worth it, but all these glitches, lags, and thirst for storage is not going to make using this app worth it. I hope someone sees this, and I hope you have a great rest of your day/night."
5,jasᵔᴥᵔ◡̈,"I love capcut! I appreciate how everything is free and how you can remove the watermark at the end. I have been using this app for like a year now and i think its great and easy to use. i do have some recommendations though because i do find some little issues or something i would like to be better/fixed. so my first recommendation is that you guys should maybe add more animations to both, texts and clips. for the texts, i think itd be cool to have more varieties to choose from. i know there's a lot of choices already but i mean that maybe if possible, there could be combos like there is for clips. i think itd look great on edits and would be very useful. and now for clips, i think if you could add more ins and out transitions, it would be fun to be able to have more transitions. maybe you could even add more combos as well. id also think a new great addition would be if there were to be more shakes and stuff. I dont think theres many shakes to add to your edits so i think more would be cool. another suggestion is to make the speed adjusts cleaner. sometimes when i make it slower, it looks blury or just doesnt look like it has the same quality as it would with normal speed. i do hsve more recommendations id like to share but i dont really know exactly how to explain it but if you could add/fix those things, i think the app would be 5x better! :)"
5,Lol_what_the_heck,"Sadly, I can’t do animation, like how I do it in KineMaster, but this is still AMAZING. the stickers are beyond adorable (some are like- uhm y’know that kind of EdGy but anyways-) it’s a great app. It’s actually a step up from KineMaster, which I did not expect. I’m so happy we are able to delete the watermark at the end, it’s just great. And everything is free! it’s awesome and it’s pretty much everything you need (sadly no animation key thing.) the chroma key is SOO good. I can remove part of my green/pink screen in the background  without any pink/green thing on my character or art disappearing! The effects are really nice and aesthetic, and some are just really cool. (some are kinda uhm weird imo) the effects are perfect for edits, the retro or vintage ones have to be my favorite! Also the in and out animations are cool, and there are some that are for the whole duration of the video/photo, which is cool. The customization abilities for the text are great. You can give the text a font, color, some special design (example: making it glow) in and out transitions, animations that last for the duration the text is on the screen, and you can put it in a text box or something, and there are some really cute ones! There is so much I haven’t explored yet,  and I know it’ll probably be good. I recommend this app for beginners, pros, anyone really. 5 stars, 10/10 I love the app  Sincerely, -a person"
5,🌸𝔸𝕚𝕪𝕒𝕟𝕒🌸,"First of all, I love this app so much, so in now way or form is this hate. I’d like to state some of my suggestions to improve CapCut! So the first suggestion I was thinking of is a feature where you can add graphs to you keyframes to make them look smoother. Another suggestion I have is more fonts. I do love some of the fonts you’ve provided us with, but I would love if there was a way we could upload our own fonts into the app. I’ve been thinking about this next suggestion for quite some time now, and I think it would be really effective and really improve this app! Maybe you could add a feature where we can make our own transitions? Now, I realize this might be a stretch, but hear me out: if we could make our own transitions, it would really increase our creativity skills. I know that other apps already have this feature, but I feel like CapCut is better, considering it’s 100% free! Oh! One more thing I’d like to mention. I was thinking you could add more mask shapes? Like maybe a feature where we could mask our own shapes? Ooh and maybe we could mask our clip and you could add a feature where we can have a glow effect around the masked area? Idk, it was just a thought. Well I hope you take some of these into consideration. Have a nice day!"
4,sdrakeofficial,"I would love a more in depth audio editing interface, with mixers for the different layers that indicate the sound levels. I’d also love the ability to use an equalizer on any audio track individually along with audio filters (Having to extract audio from a video in order to add voice effects doesn’t count). This, along with the ability to change more render settings would be great. For example, changing the bitrate for the entirety of the video could be simplified using a slider that goes from “smaller size, lower quality” to “larger size, higher quality.” The ability to render in the background would also be a much appreciated feature as a lot of us who use CapCut to edit do so on our main device that we need to access, and on larger projects it’s impossible to get a render done. Even older devices are capable of background rendering. I’m sure many people would be willing to wait for a slightly longer render in favor of being able to use their phone or tablet whilst the render is being completed. (An indicator can be used to signal whether the render is ongoing, has failed, or has finished). One last thing. Im sure many would enjoy a precision movement tool that allowed for things like key framing to be more precise when changing the size of location of a clip."
4,tddttfttl,"This is a short review bc in too lazy but the app is basically useless for me if i can’t even add a video edit a video. I’m saying this bc every time I open the app and click add it says my storage is full😐 I am mad bc i delete and delete things but it says the same thing i power off my phone but it still says that and I can’t even edit. But other than that, it’s a pretty good app u can remove the watermark FOR FREE and most editing apps make you pay. It has decent effects filters etc. overlays are good and trimming is very easy for people that just started. I think it’s a great app for first timers it’s easy to use it’s not updated very much just bug fixes and a few new effects but everything is alright. It’s easy to add your own watermark too and many choices, you can make it look like vs which is cool and useful for those who get bullied for using CapCut. Speed and velocity are something that need a bit more work I say it’s not very smooth kinda laggy too,also we need more effects don’t get me wrong the ones we have are GREAT but I feel like they’re getting… old. It’s also good it’s not all presets unlike many other apps. But yeah my honest opinion about this is good"
5,Ashley🤝,"Hello capcut team. I've made 3 reviews or more on this app, and all of them were weird..and childish. I've matured over the days, weeks, months, & years. And here's my final (?) review I hope not to change because of accidents or just, childishness. This app is overall good. Sadly, there aren't any effects I'd hope to find. But this is the most easiest app for editing I've seen. So, that's fine. Most of the transitions are good, some are meh…But it's fine if you don't mind that, and besides kinemaster it's so easy to use! The exporting is way faster than kinemaster's. if you make a 2 minute video, it's done quickly. But not in 10 seconds you actually need to wait. But for kinemaster? Pfft. Don’t even get me started! But, there is something that bothers me. The zooming in. Kinemaster's zooming is just amazing! You can do memes with it and a bunch of other stuff(Zooming in for animations, gacha life, gacha club, etc.) But capcut's zooming kinda annoys me all the time I use it. I use the key (I forgot what it's called, sorry.) thing to zoom in, but it turns out horrible. And, yes. Effects have zooming in, but those bother me too! That's the only issue I have. Buts that's all! Goodbye capcut team, Keep up the good work."
5,teuegyefeyegyegeywtywyyw,I know that some of y’all are great editors out there but I’m gonna give y’all some more things that you should probably do a .CapCut one of the first things that you should do is you should look at all the edit editing that people have been doing on there and you look at your edits from back then on your other app that you’ve been using this is completely free app you don’t need any of your money to pay for it these these are facts that are on here are really good they they have a good quality they just look good overall add a lot a lot of affects to one of your pictures or videos and one of the things that I just wanna put out there is that some of y’all are pros at this and some of y’all are not processes but that’s OK because anybody doesn’t have to be pressed to have a good editing a edit sorry no editing and if you don’t think your edit is good go back and look through and just look through the edit that you did if you don’t look through the edit that you did it’s fine because you can try affects you can try writing on it you can try doing a lot of stuff on it there’s a lot more stuff than it looks like love CapCut.
4,Jacob Frey,"I think that the app is amazing I use it on all of my TikTok videos but one very minor criticism of the app I have is that if maybe I delete some thing but i maybe deleted the wrong thing or I have a good idea that I want to put into the video I just made but because I deleted the original draft on CapCut because I was going to post a TikTok for example I won’t be able to go back and get the original draft from CapCut if I deleted it. So what I’m trying to say is I think that there should be a temporary trash pile section so that just in case somebody deleted the wrong thing or they want to edit it but didn’t expect to, they don’t have to worry about redoing everything they just did they can just go back to the original thing and recover it and just add in or take out whatever it is they were going to do. The trash pile would be the best thing that you could add to the app right now that’s the only reason I’ve given a four star review if I could’ve given a four and a half I would but it doesn’t work that way with the ratings so it really is a very minor thing but it can be quite annoying otherwise please consider it it’s very simple"
5,I have been summoned,"I make a lot of edits and capcut is great, I love the new updates lately. I do have a suggestion though,  maybe y’all could make folders for us to organize and sort out edits. I have a problem with organizing things and it would be really nice to have folders. Anyways overall this is a great app once you get the hang of it your edits will look great :) - tips - If your trying to get better quality use the effect “sharpen” you’ll have to adjust the settings of it to where the red and blue colors line up behind the black line - If your trying to make a velocity edit go to “style” dont split your clip at the beats all you have to do is wait for it to load and once it’s applied change the speed for the velocity to match the beat - To get a small flicker effect go to “text” and put “.” then change the color to white and adjust the size of it to where it’s covering the entire screen then change The opacity to 3 then go to “animation” go to ”loop” scroll over till you find “random flash” then adjust the speed as fast as it will go then click off and put it on the entire video - alright I’m done here have fun editing :)"
5,Piemaker_Pri,"So CapCut is a really great app. It has really all of the most advanced features that you couldn’t find in any other video editing app. I have seen that ads for these on Instagram and it turns out that they were not lying about these features. This is basically the sole reason why I am writing this review. I don’t even know why this app has a rating of only 4.5. It should be at least 4.8. But just like any other video editing app (I should be sorry to say this lol) it has it’s flaws. I want more filters, like an invert filter. Also some people may not understand English so it may be a problem for them if they want a video editing app that could feature their language. That also applies to the effects, filters, etc. So please, allow users to select their own language. It could also be good if you could put a dark mode, be able to save your music, or SFX to the app, and name your video before you start your project. This is all I have to say. Hopefully CapCut listens to my review, so that all users of this app could get a comfortable video editing experience."
5,Madde <,"I got to say CapCut is one of the best apps out there!! It’s 100% free, and it has amazing features! I use it all the time to make random edits or Roblox edits. It makes edits so interesting and fun to do! I definitely think there could be some improvements but then again no app is perfect, but I do have some suggestions you should take into consideration: first add more voice affects, I love this feature and it makes you voice really cool but I think it would help to add more of a variety. Next I think you should improve the volume. I like that you can change the volume but it only turns up or down so much so I think you should change that. And another one is to add more fonts I absolutely love the fonts CapCut provides but I definitely think we should be able to choose our own fonts or you could add some more. Those are just a few suggestions but over all CapCut is an amazing app that I highly recommend whoever made this app is so talented and needs a lot of credit! I think there could be a few improvements but all in all it’s definitely a great and fantastic app that makes editing easy and fun!!!"
5,JΣҒҒ,"I really like this app, it doesn’t crash like my other editing software, the transitions are amazing, the effects are out of this world, and the text customization is one I’ve never seen before on mobile Editing. I just wanted to suggest that you guys that run this app give more creative control over the effects, for example letting us fade them in and fade out, how fast or slow we want the effects. I also wanted to suggest and ask if you guys could put in an option where we just switch are clips from video to overlay and also the ability to lock/pin our overlays. Also, an option where we can automatically resize our video to full screen because since there’s not an option to it may not go 100% back to the full screen. Last thing I’d like to request is if you guys could put an option where we can unlink the audio from the video two adjusted and move around as necessary. Again this app is superb and I just think these suggestions that I’ve provided would help a lot of others editing experience on this app. Thank you for your time."
4,heylo24,"Don’t get me wrong, this app is great! It is 100% free, NO watermark, and has some really good features! It built-in stickers and filters that are well and good. Also, did I mention, IT HAS MULTIPLE LAYERS!! That’s friekin incredible!! I tested and it has up to five other layers of video or photo! This is one of the only apps on mobile that actually has multiple layers and is free! Onto the not so good things...It has most of the basic features you need EXCEPT good Volume, the volume feature is really bad, you can barely turn the volume down it only sounds SLIGHTLY quieter when you’re almost all the way at the “0” volume thing. Also, in my opinion there should be more options for volume customization maybe such as “audio stabilization” or something like that. Also the slow-down effects and the voice effects could use work. It has some really useful filters with camcorder and 90’s effects built into the app which is really cool. The transitions are actually surprisingly un-cheesy. I wanted to say thank you to the person who made this app! It is a really good app and definitely could use some changes but overall It’s really great!"
4,jejanxofjd,"I love this app! I recommend it for Gachatubers, editors, photos, aesthetic videos, YouTubers…etc. The point is: It’s a great app that is not super complicated to use. Obviously you can make it complicated if you’re more advanced (something I am not), but it’s an amazing app! The only somewhat big problem I have is that it can be slow. Usually when I add many videos/photos it starts to not download stuff into the camera roll. But that’s it and I’ve only recently have trouble when I make big projects! Thank you to the CapCut team! Keep up the good work! Edit: Hi! So it has been a LONG time of me using it- Ok not that long. Like a year or something. But anyways, it’s a great app still. The thing is it takes up SO much storage. Like I’m almost out of storage on my phone 😭 I don’t know how apps are made, but I know they all have to have certain things. If there is a way that the storage concern could be taken care of it would be greatly appreciated. 😁 I still recommend downloading this app, but be careful of the storage issue. Watch some videos to know what could cause the storage to go up to limit doing certain things!"
5,AMAGICisallaroundyou34521,"I can’t believe this app is still FREE! This is  the best editing app I have, it’s literally my life! Everything is so easy to figure out, and there’s so many things to do! It never crashes, the transitions are beautiful, there is a very wide variety of effects and so much more. First off, the transitions. They are so great, and there is so many types of them! You can keep it plain or change it up with some effects in the transition! Next, the effects. They’re so amazing, and there is so many to choose from. There are categories like bling, party, shadow, comic and more! You can also add texts to your video. You can choose how long the text stays on screen, choose from a big selection of fonts, colors and effects to your text! Again, everything is so easy to do and very easy to figure out. I use this so much for so many kinds of edits. My favorite part about this is that you can add audio. You can choose from a lot of different default sounds, extract audio from video clips, and trim the sound! CapCut is amazing, and if you’re looking for an editing app I definitely suggest this!"
5,^Gamer^Bear^,"Capcut offers so many different effects and filters to choose from. It is a free app with no adds. CapCut is great for starters or even pros! It gives you the awesome experience of a true editor, it’s highly recommended.    Will you be the next to download?  Dear owner of CapCut, I would like to tell you an idea that I have for a effect. So the effect would basically be like a zooming in effect. There will be 5-20 pictures on a screen that the editor will pick the background color of. They can pick 5-20 photos out of their albums and then place them on the screen. They will look like little pictures that you would take out of a polaroid camera. Then once their music hits the beat drop then the zoom comes in. It will automatically zoom in to a random photo that the editor has chosen. Then their will be some shakes or  other effects that will be given to make the edit look good. And the. It will zoom out of the picture and then zoom into another. This will happen 2-3 times. And yeah, that’s my idea thanks for your time!"
4,TheF0xL0ver,"When I heard about CapCut, I was so amazed by it I wanted to download it right away. And when I did, it was amazing! It has great features, such as animations, stickers, and even adding your own fonts from downloaded files! And I’m in love with the new graph setting for key points! Except, that’s what has been glitching lately. I was working on an edit when I needed to use key points for an overlay. I made the key points, no problems yet, until I added the graphs. When I selected one, the second key point reset all the adjustments I made to the overlay. The chroma key and movements went back to its original state. The first key point remained the same though. At first I thought it was only a minor glitch, but when I clicked undo and tried again, the same thing happened. I tried undoing the key point, adding the overlay again, I even exported the edit and made a new project to try again, but nothing worked. CapCut has lagged in the past, but that’s only because there were a ton of effects or overlays. This is a real problem. Overall, great app, but frustrating glitches."
5,lakadased,So I download capcutToday and there’s no problem with this so far but I just wish that you could be able to search up the music because I feel like some of the songs on there aren’t what I’m looking for for the video that I making for Tiktok or for YouTubeAnd I don’t really like switching through other apps to add the certain type of music that I want or just have to go and TikTok and screen record and then like at the music from the video so I just wish that you could make an option where you can search up whatever song that she whines that I have an added on other platforms and even though you can do Apple Music I don’t have Apple Music so I just feel like that you should have the option to be able to search up the song instead of having to pick whatever songs are on there even though don’t give me wrong the songs are not bad they are very good but I just wish that I could listen to some songs with lyrics and something that is more me so I hope you see this and I hope I enjoy this app even more.
5,.Afton Fan.,"I think this is a great app, it’s really fun with all the things that it has. I just think that it’s just a really great editing app 100% free for all the effects & watermark and I also have a few suggestions which is that maybe you could try to add different languages for people that don’t speak or understand English, yet I don’t know if your working on that feature and I think would you maybe add some more option to have like a in & out & combo together for the I really forgot the name - but I think you could maybe add some more options for the texts like maybe a out animation and combos, again I don’t know if this is already a feature, but I’ve seen adds for the app and they don’t lie about the features and things and I think it’s really cool how you can change the speed of the video in your own way and how the app has so maybe features. I just think it’s also really easy to use and understand how to use the app so I suggest some of the things I listed to be addded to the app thank you for reading!. - .Afton Fan."
4,danfanderp,"OK, so first of all, it works beautifully! I dislike the fact that sometimes it kicks you out of the app but that might just be my phone. Also with all the people saying that you can't upload videos over fifteen minutes long, have you ever heard of ""Video merging""??? Also I found that if there is something like a background or something like that you can use iMovie for an easier upload (Might just be me but it kept crashing). I also use iMovie for videos over fifteen minutes long so they can be, over fifteen minutes long (XD). But I do have a suggestion with the app creators:  Could you please put in an option to start a template without having a video? It would be a lot easier to record straight from the app then having to do the process of recording, then uploading, then cropping everything and all that jazz. It's just so much easier to record straight from the app! But in total, if it wasn't for the recording thing I give it a solid 4/5 stars.   (By the way if a developer reads this and puts in thanks so much!)"
5,dijwjsmxmalallaow,"CapCut is an AMAZING editing app for new beginner editors, people don’t see it as an editing app but it is when you get to see more of the like transitions, effects etc. there’s so many things you can do with this app though there are presets you can use those presets and combine them with other presets.   Now my suggestions. I think if there were graphs and making your own transitions would be AMAZING, maybe if there were also motion blur in effects or like mirror like titles in alight motion it would be great and maybe even pass alight motion, and lastly maybe you could add like titles for your project incase you are deleting projects (for storage) so you don’t delete something you don’t want to delete.   This app is already amazing so if you’re a beginner editor you should use CapCut it’s amazing it has great transitions, effects etc more things than alight motion has but alight motion is still advance with the graphs etc. So you should start with CapCut honestly before using any other big editing apps like alight motion or AE."
4,3lena9anuel,"CapCut is great, but there are some down hills on it, so CapCut i'd  appreciate if you'd read this and take in some suggestions of what to add to your app. not only will these suggestions hopefully boost your ratings and downloads but could also help the improvement of editing and of course better quality! 1: smoother slow-mo. i will admit the slow-mo is pretty bad. its laggy and just not very good. 2: graphs, OMG i swear CapCut, graphs would be SOO helpful! not only for premade animations but for keyframes and overlays! it would help make animation smoother and fit with the kind of theme people are trying to do, and over all easier. 3: this one isnt very important, but being able to add overlays more than once at a time. if someone is planning on adding quite a few overlays to their videos its frustrating having to add them one at a time. 4: the abilty to add splice to text without having to make a video and overlay to your other one!   anyways these were just suggestions, but i do know many people agree with me so CapCut, please add these things! minus that this app is really good!"
5,Verxon,"this app is really cool! It has like things I can do whenever I’m bored sometimes, it’s okay just I think one part that gets me questioning myself is the part where every time I like add animations for each video then add to the others I go back to the start of the edit and see the animation doesn’t play so I usually repeat it but that’s okay! Just questioned myself about that nothing wrong, and I also love it how when you add auto captions like say for example you add a video with muffled words and you don’t understand a little so you add the auto caption it’s like this whole or the whole system just has like big ears or something cause it’s like awesome. To me it’s like really extraordinary because I have never done this before and now I started to use this app it’s like really different for me, because I used to be a lazy person and just use templates but when really I wanted to do more like experience more so when I did that I just couldn’t believe it, it was just amazing 🤩 💖💪😎 (and yes I am 7 and kid so I wrote this)"
5,6371826256181947,Love app but I have a few suggestions first the slow speed   try to make it look good it’s glitchy and overall I don’t like it second better quality to make edit look nice and clean like if it were a edit of a person make good quality so it doesn’t look like it is blurry 3rd of all the affects some things you can add is different blurry into focus and when it is blurry maybe make it look cool like add shapes 4th add a update where it flashes on the beat or color 5th suggestion the transitions make good looking ones that are smooth6th maybe there gonna be an option where you can select certain parts of the edit such as if you were doing a edit of a person you can select a place where are you either want to flash black or white or rainbow6th all the fonts on the app don’t look nice maybe have nice looking ones that will make edits look different fonts would be nice. Hope you take my suggestions into consideration love the app and hope to see more updates
5,dreamPandaJupiter376,Okay to be honest (tbh) this is the best app I have on my phone rn so I recommend it and here are reasons why to download it just in case you don’t know for sure.1# you can learn how to use all the tools in one minute okay so when I first got this app I edited Rick Astley never gonna give you up and I learned the tools in one minute but it felt like 1 second and I still have it today 😂 2# no offense Kinemaster but this is better than KineMaster but this is my opinion if you use kinemaster and like it better than it’s okay  3# If your a beginner than this app is for you   And that’s all know I have some suggestions idk if you have this one because I been using this app for 10 months but can we add a loop like on you have a video and they restart it without you knowing and if you have it then please tell me how idk if you do so that’s just a suggestion ty for reading this review pls put my suggestion in the game ty so much making a app that beginners  pros  hackers can use ty                From : Jupiter
5,Tanner Ω,"So if you’ve seen the ads for this app, you’re probably like “they’re just saying that, it’s not that easy” but no, it really is! CapCut is definitely the easiest editing software I’ve used and you probably don’t need a tutorial for how to use it because of how simple it is! In just a few minutes you’ll be making unbelievable edits you didn’t think you could make, it’s really just the best app for editing if you’re just starting out, looking for something simpler, or anything else! Of course it has its flaws, like when you’re selecting an animation it’ll lag a bit until you select the animation which is a little annoying because if you don’t like it you have to deselect the animation tool, but doesn’t really affect the quality or anything, and sometimes it’s hard to time things right when it tries to put it in place for you, but overall just an amazing app! I’ve made such amazing edits with this app, I can’t believe how well they turned out and how easy it was to make them."
3,Vivi🥺😂😄😜😎,I download this app with my friend told me that it was great editing out for my channel when I first download the app I loved it so much I started immediately working on the intro for my channel but I had started to have some problems and it was my bedtime so I went to bed in the next morning it wasn’t letting me go into it wasn’t letting me go into what I was editing so I deleted many of my apps so I could continue using this one app because it said not enough storage and I wasted so many apps for it to not even let me in so I think it’s like a bug or some thing I think you guys should make it so some people look at it can get in I don’t know if this is like for everyone it’s just me and I don’t know if it’s on my end or your end so if it’s on my end please let me know also when I deleted the app to see if I could re-open the app and I could use it again to continue to start over with the editing it wouldn’t let me download it I’m pretty sure that part is on my end but I just wanted to say it that game is really really good though it’s not a game it’s an editing app but I love it so much
4,unicorn cool cake,First of all the app is wonderful for editing stuff you can do so many things with it and you can upload it to TikTok so anything you create you can post on TickTock which I find amazing and helpful. But the first thing I would have to suggest is an eraser because every time I go on TickTock and like screenshot or something or some thing is in the way and then I can’t use it because there isn’t an eraser and then every time I go on different apps to see if they have an a racer they do but it’s only if you pay like $30 a month and I’m not gonna do that that’s way too expensive just for me to use an eraser. So please add an eraser and the second thing I want to add is please try to add some handmade videos like you could add like aesthetic clips or like some Gothic clips or like some stuff to make your stuff look a little bit better you don’t have to I know it takes a long time for you to read some suggestions and do it but for future notice please try to think about these suggestions
3,Xococo,It’s an OK app and for video editing it’s pretty reliable but if you try and use their templates they tend to get corrupted and turn black and stop working also if you try and select photos after you select one it will take you back to the top and if you’ve selected a certain folder it’ll take you out of that folder but it doesn’t do that with videos. So adding videos to edit is really easy but if you want to add photos it’s going to take a lot of time or you need to go into your Photos app and favorite all of them first and then try and open them one by one from the favorite album but it still sends you to the top after each selection so it’s very tedious and time-consuming. I originally used InShot for all my video editing and then switched over to CapCut after learning about it on Tiktok but I think I’ll switch back to InShot now. Essentially they feel like they do the same things but InShot never fails me or glitches while CapCut glitches often. Also I’ve never had an issue saving a large file from InShot but I have had several issues saving large files from CapCut.
5,iiMyra,"Ok, I gotta say even tho I’m 11 I have never found any other better editing app than CapCut. It’s so good in so many ways. Like you could go to any other editing app and it would have a watermark and it would make you pay for extra transitions, filters, etc, and you could just say it wasn’t even that good. CapCut however, haha I cant even explain how helpful it has been! I suppose one thing I could suggest is making more of like you know transitions like shaking ones and bouncing ones because personally I use this app to edit my roblox tiktoks. Otherwise it has so many different things to choose from like filters, texts, you can even crop the video size! How amazing now I don’t even need my other apps because I have an iPhone 6. It also allows you to save videos up to however long which is so useful because I used another app and you couldn’t even save it if it was over 15 or 30 seconds! Can you believe that?!? Anyways thank you so much CapCut this app is amazing!! <3"
3,Needs some tips!,"This app is amazing. But the actual app size changed my phone. Storage on my phone was so bad I had to delete it and now my storage is way better. Although this app is absolutely amazing and helps me edit my other things, I do think the sizing is a little bit too much. I’m not a good expert at knowing how to change things, but if it could be changed I would like the app size to be a little different. This is pretty cool but I never knew how to use the green screen also. I never saw it anywhere but I’ve seen so many people use the green screen effect on cap cut. If that could be changed everything would be awesome because I’ve been looking for the green screen button for so long. I’ve been using this app for months now and I do think that I’m getting the hang of it. It is a little confusing which I wish that could change but I mean, it’s an editing app it takes practice. Anyways overall the only reason why I think it’s a three is because it is a little confusing to do and the size is really bad. But I do think this app is very helpful."
5,Ja'Seanna,"Im giving this app a 5 star i  didnt checked the app out at first i was just scamming though it , it have everything i was looking for in one . All the other apps  had only one particular thing i was looking for and then i had to download more & more apps just to make make my videos complete and successful , but this app it have everything in one . I havent made a full video yet but for all the people that says the app cant go over 15mins , not calling you out or anything but if you think wisely and smart you would come up with a thing “make the video til were it stops , then create a whole nother video were you left off , then add them both together.” I havent tried this idea on my own yet but i have a little faith that its gonna work because they literally blessed me with this app and it dont have “capcut” on the side of it to let people know what you edit your videos with . I dont know about the other people having problems with it but me myself is A-ok! 🙃💕💕."
4,Yaldemar,"Ive been using capcut for most of my content on tiktok, its an amazing app to use, its free, convenient, has no ads, and its not so complicated to use. Theres only one big issue at the moment. I have no idea if people are going through this or its just me but ive been experiencing some glitches related to the app. When i try to zoom in, it’ll constantly reset from where I previously was, and when i try cropping it to another place on my video or photo it’ll do the exact same thing. Ive also tried putting video over another to add effects to my video, but the video seems invisible for some reason, and instead of playing the video without sound when scrolling through the bar, it’ll just cut into frames and make it impossible for me to time things correctly. Again, i have no idea if other users are facing this but please i beg you to fix this. Its starting to turn my 1-2 hours pf editing to 3-4, its driving me NUTS; but overall i really enjoy using this app!"
4,STRANGER034,"So I like this app and have no problem in it. I recommend this app for content creators. And it has the features that make my videos twice as more entertaining. And I recommend this app because it’s better than kienmaster and other editing app I’ve used and less complex. Although, there are two issues, when I often export my videos, (reminder that this happened yesterday and today) I wait so long for it to finally export just to have the exporting process fail. Not only the slow exporting is an issue but it says that my storage is too much and I thought my storage was the case. And I started deleting unwanted apps to save storage to only experience the same issue AGAIN. I have has less GB of storage yet it asks me to try again or whatever. All I know is that this issue never seemed to happen to me when I used the app the day before yesterday please fix the exporting issue. I would rate it 5/5 if you could. And if it’s not CapCut or my GB of storage, let me know."
5,GamergirlXxxxd,"So I’ve used CapCut since 2020, and I’ve always loved it.  One thing is the slow mo, especially when trying to edit an animation. It could be smoother, but that’s not something that makes the app horrible. Actually, nothing about the app is bad! But I have two recommendations for it. Could you add a twixor like affect? It may be difficult, but that would make the app much better. One more thing, I don’t think you know this but, if I use copyright © audio, you won’t get the fine, so I think you should add “ good “ audios because these ones are just non copyrighted material. You could at-least add anime or Japanese songs, but I’m not complaining, because I usually just use extracted.  Also, can you make it so I can edit how much I use the voice affect? I would like to make two voices go together for something, but the deep voice affect is too much, so could you let us adjust how much we use thee? Besides my greedy recommendations, this app is lovely!"
4,Goood2121,"So this is an amazing app! It has great transitions animations and filters, and i LOVE how there is no watermark! But some things are messing up.  	Once i was making an edit and when it has the finishing CapCut watermark clip, i added a heart where it says to add a text. Now, i started making an edit and the heart text wont go away. (The two edits are completely different.) Now when i try to play my edit, there is a <3 in the middle of my clips. I cant make it go away and i have no idea whats happening. I even tried to change the text but thats not working either, the heart is permanent. Thats the only downside about mine.  	But, you know after effects right? Well, I’m on a mobile device so i dont have after effects. But, when you add key frames on after effects, you can do a graph as-well the graphs make the key frame animations much much smoother. (I know this by watching ae/after effects edits). Is it possible if CapCut can do the graph aswell? Its ok if its not possible. Thank you!"
5,𝕢𝕨𝕢,"When I first started video editing, this was the second app I stumbled across, and I haven’t switched since. I almost immediately understood the controls and began making edits. The effects are all amazing, (shakes, transitions, video effects,  animations, etc.) but could be more advanced. While you can export a video after having used one animation then add another in a different project, that is extremely tedious. All I’m asking for is smoother, more professional looking animations (mainly shake animations that don’t look choppy 😭) Still, I have nothing against this app and highly recommend it. The only problem I’ve had is with the smooth slow motion effect making weird, green frames within the video clip your trying to apply the effect to. Otherwise, everything works amazingly. It always blows me away to see what people can create in this app, and what continues to be added. I won’t switch editing softwares for a LONG time. ❤️"
5,Xx_Sinnxr_xX,"First let me clear this up. I’ve seen a lot of reviews saying “CapCut supports the Ukrainian and Russian war because they took away CapCut in Ukrainian!!!!!” Well how do you know the owner supports it?!?! You have to consider stuff. Like how would they be able to use the app right now anyway they are in the middle of war!   And also what if there’s a bug or something in Ukrainian and they can’t use the app. Second I’ve seen a lot of things saying “it’s not synced” or what so ever but this is not a put in a photo and be done with it app though it’s very easy to use. It’s a great app and one of the best and easiest editing apps I’ve seen. It’s free though there is a premium. But you can use it without the premium! I definitely recommend this app! If you just get it and need help, there’s loads of tutorials out there to help you! This is a great app! Thank you for reading this, I hope it helps! Have a great day/night! Bye!"
4,Dopeplayer42,"Honestly, I love CapCut. It is so simple and easy to use. I don’t have to pay for anything. Although, I have seem some problems lately. First of all, we do not need this many fonts. Half the time some of them don’t even work. If you’re going to continue to add more, please add a “favorites” section for the text. It would be really useful because I only have two major fonts I use so scrolling through, trying to find them, gets annoying. Also, if I am working on a edit and I mute the sound for The whole thing, I USED to be able to change the volume on other clips. For some reason I can’t do that know? It’s really annoying having to go through ALL the clips and mute them just because I needed one to have sound. It would be really nice if you could stop adding so many texts and features to the app. It’s supposed to be simple and the more and more stuff you add, the more complicated it will become. I really do love this app, but it does need some changes."
4,ostrich bakers,"First of all, CapCut is a great app for beginners and it’s easy once you get used to it though I’ve been using CapCut for a while and I can’t help but want more. Also there is a problem with the storage, if you make a video on CapCut and save it, you can find out that CapCut itself actually is the cause of full storage, not the video itself, but I have found some solutions, use less effects and add ones so you can have less storage it’ll take, but if you really wanna use a lot, delete it off CapCut after saving it so you can only access it in your video album, this prevents most to all the storage that one video will take up, but the problem with that is, if you notice a mistake while watching it, you can’t go back. It’s not easy to edit on top of it so you’ll have to live with it. I get annoyed by this but I need to save storage to make more videos. I hope you understand. Pls fix it.🌼🌸🌵"
5,HUGOlovesTRAINZ,"I absolutely love CapCut to death, it’s my favorite editing app thus far. It gives me so many tools and edits smoothly and with ease. I do want to say however, whenever I try to export some videos in full 4K quality and 60 FPS, it crashes at 70% or 80% of exportation (I have an iPhone 13 so I don’t think it’d be processing on my end) is there any way y’all can fix this? It would be so very appreciated, because I really want to export some of my projects in lossless quality. Whenever it does export, CapCut makes it look so pristine and smooth, so of course I’d want most of my videos to export as such! A suggestion I’d love to see added into the app is effects being able to fade in and out, a lot of the effects have harsh cuts and I usually can only attach it to a frame to make it seem-less, I’d love to see the team add fading options in and out for the overlay effects that they give us. Overall I love the app, keep doing your thang!"
5,Frenda24,"so capcut is an amazing app, the only thing i really have wrong with it is that it needs a bit more features but my problem is probably gonna be solved in no time because recently capcut has been adding a lot of updates! keep ‘em coming cause this may be better than after effects soon! now the best thing that i 𝐋𝐎𝐕𝐄 about this app is that it’s so easy! i remember when i first downloaded this app i was hoping it’s easy because i’ve downloaded SO MANY editing apps but deleted them all because of how hard it is, stuff like : kinemaster, after effects, and more but when i first downloaded this and did my first edit it was 𝐒𝐎 𝐄𝐀𝐒𝐘, 𝐒𝐎 𝐒𝐌𝐎𝐎𝐓𝐇, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐎 𝐆𝐑𝐄𝐀𝐓. the fact that this app is even free is just chefs kiss! and yea that’s all i have to say, thanks for reading my review and i recommend for you to download this. love y’all, stay safe! ♥︎"
5,a.clown.in.a.circus,"I am an editor, currently working on an analog horror series, and I am glad to say that your app was amazing! You haven’t disappointed me one bit. The effects are amazing, the options are amazing, the results are stunning, and overall I am just very thankful that this app exists! Because of the title of the review, I just want to make a suggestion with the retro option in the video effects. Do you know about the “TV Lines” effect? Well, I was hoping you can make a similar effect where it is held on the frame option. What I want how the effect to look is the same as Videoleap’s one where one of the glitch effect is called CRT. I want that effect to be the exact same as Videoleap’s if that’s possible to you, that’s basically all I ask for honestly. Anyways, keep up the good work and I hope you will see this message and take my request.  - Ultidude"
5,unicorn156🦄🦄,"I love this app a whole ton and I suggest it for beginners because it’s super easy to use and doesn’t cost anything! I use it for all my edits, but I have a few suggestions. I wish transitions were a little smoother, because it brings the whole frame with them and I wish they could add a smooth button or something. I also wish that they add more filters, meaning that you don’t have to work super hard and make multiple edits just to add a cool filter. Also, I wish they had a few more audios that could fit with “trends” I guess. I make anime edits a lot so more of a variety of audios would be amazing. One more thing, I wish that the Keyframe would also be smoother, like you could adjust how fast and slow the key frame is without adjusting the speed of the actual video. I think that’s it for suggestions but other then that I love this app and hope to keep using it more and more!"
5,horsegirlholly😘,"This is one of the best editing apps that I have ever used, and I use it to post videos, and its very cool. I was thinking of a recommendation, that you could add in the effects, hit video effects then there could be a flash choice, because I don't like making my own with Overlay, but otherwise, I haven't met another editing app better then this one. I love editing on it, because it is easy. Maybe you could also add something where you could make the video glossy, so we don't need to go threw mirror and stuff. But other than that it is awesome. If you want to make edits with Top Hits and stuff, there's a lot of songs from that, and you can use the music from videos you have recorded. It's a really good edtiting app and I would recommend it to anyone who likes editing and likes challenges and to explore, and mess around with stickers and more."
5,hehebdjejsbw,This app is amazing it is completely free. I first saw it from my friends and I didn’t know what the ruckus was about when they started. They told me that it was amazing and they couldn’t get their faces out of this app. So I tried it to see if it was worth it and I fell inlove with it the first day I had it. It has so many unique features about it. So many edit features and the best part all for free. It was the fact that you could do and use so many features that normal apps would make you pay money for. All I would like to say is that this app is amazing and I highly recommend it.( can probably be used for 9-10 up because I think this a safe app kids can use because you can’t buy anything and really no violence unless you import a bad video other then that yeah I think it can be used for the younger kids too) this took to long to write 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
5,PuppyLoverForever9,"This is a very good editing app, but one little problem. I’m trying to download a video I made but it’s saying “There isn’t enough storage on your device. Try cleaning up drafts or free up more storage.” I did what it told me to do. I deleted all my drafts except the 2 I’m working on, and it still said the same thing! I thought maybe it meant all the video’s I used in my photos, so I deleted all the videos I used for making the one I’m trying to download. It still didn’t work. Than I decided to write a Review, but I saw it said “Update,” I thought that was the problem. When it was done updating, again it said “There isn’t enough storage on your device. Try cleaning up drafts or free up more storage.” I have no idea what to do. I tried everything!! It is an 25 and 33 second video. Is that the problem?? Please let me know how to fix it!! Thank you."
4,Axoltolking123,I love editing its my life even capcut it’s so entertaining Gacha I one of my top things too do in capcut I live this app just one thing though the app is great but over the many months I’ve been using this app it started to not work as much anymore you see I’m not sure if it’s a glitch with the app like if you use it much or maybe my iPads software doesn’t work with it anymore it could really be anything what’s happening to the app is that all my favorite sounds are not in my favorites and everytime I go to a new sound bar it will say there’s no WiFi connection even when I still have full bar so I decided to delete the game then reinstall it again when I got back on it ALL MY VIDEOS WERE GONE 😡😡😡 I was so mad and I was out of options too make the app work again so yeah that’s my review so I’m pretty sure this is a glitch great app but please fix the glitch 😊
5,Lauren Hansen (Randolph),"When I started, I didn’t know many features, but as I explored, about a month later I started using overlays, keyframes, velocity, things like that! CapCut is my #1 editing app because everything is free, and it has pre-made animations and effects that you can easily use by just tapping a button. I can’t explain in words how much I love this app!!! I would definitely recommend downloading it! I only have one complaint, but it’s still 5 stars. I’m on an iPad that doesn’t have too mic storage(I know that’s not the apps fault😅) and the more edits you make and export, the more and more storage it takes up (obviously). But I feel like it takes up a little more storage than it should, because CapCut isn’t that advanced so it wouldn’t have so much to save. But there’s nothing you can do to fix that, just my crappy iPad that has 32gb total 🤠 still the best app"
5,iPadRick8,"I was really becoming irritated by the severely limiting special effects on TickTock, and then my girlfriend on TickTock suggested CapCut. I was totally blown away but what I could do with this incredible app. The effects were superior and I love The video transparency affects to create stunning videos. I am a creator and a singer however I would really like to see some nice echo and vocal effects in the audio section of CapCut. Stuff like allowing you to have different echo, reverberation affects when adding vocals to your videos. And also having control over the reverb and echo delay time etc. Additionally it would be fantastic to have a fade in, and fade out of the visual effects so they could blend in more effectively. Other than these two features this is my app it’s incredible and I just love love love it. Best app ever for special effects. Thank you so much CapCut 💛💛💛🧡🧡🧡❤️❤️❤️"
3,✨Princess of everything✨,"I love this app, I use it to edit all my videos and pictures! I think it’s really amazing if your a beginner at editing. It’s very easy to learn. And they even have tutorials on how to do stuff on the app. But there’s one problem that irritates me. When I’m watching one of my videos I edited on CapCut sometimes it does not work and goes black when I can clearly see I did not put black on my video. And sometimes I can’t see my video. I’ve tried turning it off and on etc. But sometimes it finally comes back on and it’s not black anymore. Also sometimes when that happens I tried getting out of the app and getting back in. And then when I go back some of the things I did before I got out of the app is not there anymore. This is really annoying, there’s no words to describe how my much I hate this. And then sometimes I even have to start over. If you get really mad easily then I don’t suggest this app. Because it has a ton of beyond annoying glitches!"
3,sexy misalem,"At first this app was really good and simple for me as a beginner. Now it has a lot of bugs, first of all when i try to make a edit it cuts of the sude of it like it is a phone sized frame. I have tried changing the crops but it won’t work. Also i don’t edit on a phone, i edit on a ipad. Another bug with this is that i like my ipad side ways but when i open up the app it is the opposite way, it is really annoying, i  have to remove the app first then open it again. Also sometimes when im editing and want to add a photo it says “sorry no photos.” Or something like that even though i saved photos for my edits litterly 10 secounds ago. These are the top bugs that i find really annoying. Please fix these, i really like calcut and it is a awesome app but when it comes to editing it has problems. I really like to edit on this app but with the bugs it has i don’t think i can anymore. So please the developers of CapCut pleaee fix these bugs."
5,Blitzo_64,"I’ve seen a few mobile editors, not too many, but out of the free ones, this definitely gives you everything you’ll need for what you pay for. While you may not get incredibly fancy features like a lot of audio tools, you do get a lot to work with.  My only suggestions are, as mentioned earlier, maybe some more audio tools like free adjustments of pitch and bass and such, and a speed adjustment for the entire video. Many times I’ll be trying to line up a photo or video with the best of some audio, but it’s so hard because i cannot slow down everything at once and do what I’m trying to accomplish and I end up spending 5-10 minutes trying to match one beat to a frame. A simple tab that make the entire video slowed down or sped up, without impacting the individual speed settings if existing clips."
5,Opin918273645,"Love this app so much. Maintains the quality of my clips, the lighting/hue/sharpen/etc is great. You can even import clips from Google Drive straight into your open project! Lots of cool effects, and while it’s simple and easy to use, the features provide me with lots of opportunity to make my edits more advanced if I put in the effort.   My only complaints are glitch-related— 1st and most frustrating, the audio, once exported, is frequently a tad offset; 2nd, the exported product includes extra frames that I can’t find in-app (no matter how much I trim off); 3rd, several of the transitions lag or get jerky; and 4th, lastly, it could just be me, but I’ve never been able to get match-cut to work.   Hopefully those 4 things will improve in updates, because it’s a fantastic app that I am super, super grateful to use for free."
5,guardian108,"No ads, no subscription or pro version, no bars on the side. This app is perfect for people who are new to editing, it’s totally free and doesn't beg you for a subscription every 10 seconds, and the amount of editing choices you have at hand are amazing,  I’ve had capcut for around a year or 2 now and the only thing that I don’t like is the amount of storage it takes up but that’s not their fault. Definitely recommend it, and it’s easy to use on a phone, sometimes if you have big fingers though you’ll have a difficult time making short split videos or clicking the video in between the two splits if you cut them close to each other. Other than that this app is the best free app out there on mobile for editing/making movies and trailers, I’ve had so much fun with this app it’s amazing!"
5,Irealy_hatepink,"I really like the app and it is very easy to use, but there are 2 tiny issues that I’ve faced while using it. Every time I enter the app it rotates and turns sideways so I have to aggressively turn my device side to side to get it back in my preferred rotation. I also had a hard time adding multiple short pictures for an animation because every time I tried to check my work to see how it looked it was VERY choppy and I had to save the entire video just to see how a tiny snippet looked which made it hard to check mistakes. These both got so annoying it was hard to get motivated to even use the app. Again it’s very good and I suggested this to many people but theses issues really bother me so some how fix it if you can, not sure if it’s just my device but my device is very new so I would be worried if it was."
5,Hannaceline24,"I’ve been using Capcut for some time, and it’s been amazing! Though from the title, I have three minor complaints- nothing too serious though.  Number one: you have to individually select the pictures/videos instead of being able to select and drag- which doesn’t seem too annoying at first, but kills your time when having to select hundreds of pictures at once 😅 Number two: You can only select one picture/video for overlay at a time. Again, it doesn’t seem too annoying at first, but increases later on. For example, using a green screen. The green screen would be the main, while the others that would be on top would be the overlay. So it just gets annoying after a while. Number three: The animations sometimes don’t show up when you play it.  That’s it!"
4,REAL/Chif,It’s an amazing app and has so many ways you can edit videos but it is glitchy and when I downloaded the app I noticed when I made my first edit that it was glitchy but my battery was at 23 percent so I thought it was my battery level so I charged my phone to 100 percent and when I was done making the edit and played it to see what the end result was and it was not as glitchy but still a bit glitchy. But thats my only concern about this app truly it’s a good app to do edits on and has lots of ways to make your edits fun to create it does not take a long time to get the hang of the controls it’s pretty easy to me. It’s a nice app and a fun experience I have been looking for a editor app that is easy to use because all of the editor apps I have downloaded have confusing controls and CapCut have easy controls and it takes a few minutes to learn them.
5,Cløudy_Skies41,"I love this app! It’s really easy to use, it’s simple, the videos turn out amazing, and it’s fun editing with this app! There’s one thing in particular that i have a suggestion for though. The new feature where you can record yourself and use cool-trendy filters is everything i could ask for! But i just wish you could export sound from a video in your camera role and stop and play again the video with the same sound, if you get what i’m saying. Like a lip sync, you know? But you can also pause what your doing, get into another position, and start recording with the sound exactly where you paused the video. I just think it’d be much more helpful for people like me, and i hope you consider adjusting it so that people can do this little recommendation. Thank for reading, have a great day!"
4,Ana1984777,"I LOVE THIS APP! It is easy to use and I love that. I love everything about it except for one thing... it consumes A LOT of storage and even after I delete projects, it will still fill my storage. I have tried to clear the cache and it will say it’s clear yet still my storage is full from this app. I have to delete the app every time I use it to clear the “documents and data” storage. I appreciate that this app saves your videos so that you can delete them from your camera roll without them deleting in the app, but once I edit the videos, the parts I take out should delete from the storage too or something because it’s such a pain. I end up editing like an hour worth of videos down to 10-15 min total then can’t save the video cause my storage is full. Please please please just fix the cache so we can clear the data not used. Thanks"
4,LlamaYoMamaLily,"So I’ve made many CapCut edits for my friends. However today everything was strange I tried to create another video however it did not work it told my my phone storage was full so I thought I had to delete some photos so I did then after deleting a lot I came back and it said the same thing I asked my smart bestie and she said to delete some of the videos you need after deleting like 20 or 30 it still said the same thing. Can you please fix this I wanna make more videos please.      My opinion on the editing:  Overall the choices are very nice but I’d like to do some more transitions. Also some more effects I’m not saying the effects are bad I love them they’re awesome ! But they can get a little old by time but I still use them thanks for taking the time to read this, You should definitely install this app it’s the best video editor ever! 😊💖✅💚👌💐"
5,Jacqui❤️,"Wish I could give the app more stars. All features are incredibly intuitive and can be quickly understood, which makes the app perfect for those new to video editing/edit videos for casual use. There’s also a hefty selection of tools which can even be overlapped to create more interesting effects. Everything is really so versatile, I feel like I can always learn something new to do. The best part of the app, though, is that it is COMPLETELY FREE!! There are NO IN-APP PURCHASES OR ADS, which is the downfall of every other editing app I’ve ever encountered. I actively worry every day that CapCut is going to introduce in-app purchases, because it’s genuinely unreal how GREAT this FREE app is. The best of its kind— if you have any interest in amateur videography, this app is a must. CapCut, if you’re reading this, please never start charging for features. I will cry lol"
5,woman's king such love,"Ok um this app is amazing I’ve been using it for 2-3 years now and I still haven’t learned everything! But I have a few things I request you add. First I was wonder if we could had thing where you hold down on the diamond and there’s a animation mode where you put all oth the parts your animating with and they are in layers That you can speed up, move, and colorize with effects and filters. If you want an example look up flamango animater tut on yt. Also can you make the slowmos more smooth? Whenever you slow something down the frame rate starts to be all staggered and delayed so it makes it look like a low quality vid. Also um can you make a filter for a flash and fade effect? Where it’s a white flash and it fades but it’s looks like it’s on the overlay setting? That’s all for now but IM HAVING TROUBLE REDOWNLOADING IT 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭"
4,Hejdhsbd,"It is great! No watermark, free, nice effects, my friend is a pro at this!! I'm still new, but can you do a little change with the storage thing? I have around 200 pictures of a video I want to do, and need to post a video for my friend. Sadly, it says that I need to clear up some storage, I made hard work with the pictures. ( I am doing a Gacha Life thing with CapCut!!) I made part 1 of what I am doing and that got myself around 30-40M! So now it keeps telling me to clear up some storage. I just get a mixed feeling of mad and sad, I really need to make part 2 of it but I can't. I also need to show part 1 of the video to my friend I was talking about earlier. I really want to show her how good I did with it! So, can you please fix the storage thing? If it takes a while that is totally fine, just do whatever to fix up the storage thing. In any other word, keep up the good work! 😁"
5,jr is stupid,This app is great and easy! And I was pleased to see that it was free! But I think an update could be that you make videos and interact with other people on the app and then can put up un edited videos up on the different tab and you can go on edit and press done then it would send the creator a message/notification saying you edit it it for them and they can approv it and put a 1-5 start rating and if you do that you can like get stars which can get you something new and they add 3 things everyday but you might not get them and it will say better luck next time and you can comment on videos. Like a editing version of tiktok!! Ik this is a long shot idea for you guys to see this but I think it’s is a great idea. But you don’t have to listen to me!😀Nice Game!! Thanks for reading🦋God bless you all!!🙏🏽💗PEACE🔥
1,TKWoobles,"Kinda bad. It’s so hard to edit the layers, I can’t really put text in there too, it’s really hard to just make one simple video, and when you’re editing the layers, even if it says like 3 seconds, it goes by so fast and it’s really just one second. I have a lot of issues with the app, but the ads, oh my god the ads... I mean it’s pretty debatable because I do have an Apple device, usually if I download an app on an Apple device I get more ads then usual. But the ads stop my editing in between here and there, and when I’m trying to edit something I lose my progress and it’s just very annoying to see that your hard work is gone just because of ads. REMOVE THE ADS! I lose hours of hard work and have to restart them. This one time I had been working on something for 7 hours, because it’s so hard to edit, an ad came up and BAM! Progress lost. Then after I tried it again right when I was at the end, of course another ad. So annoying. Do not download this app unless you want to lose hours of hard work. Developers, please fix this!"
5,SweetHoneyKitten,"This has to be one of the best video editing apps I’ve seen on the App Store! It has lots of effects, transitions, animations, and more that you usually can’t get for free. And yes, it’s all free. This app is really useful when I’m editing my animations, and it’s especially great because there’s no watermark. There are a few things I would suggest be added. First, there is no key frame and what I do needs key framing. Second, I wish there was a way to add more video layers without it having to be an overlay. Maybe it’s possible but I haven’t been able to so far. And lastly, I would recommend an effect or animation that is a slight camera shake (I don’t know how to explain it better). So if you could add those it would be wonderful. Overall, this is one of the best editing apps I’ve worked with. Thank you for reading my review!"
5,OhMyPaws,"I love the app, its easy to use and understand which is hard to find nowadays and it says a lot just to acknowledge how someone who is hard of understanding as me can fully process how this app works. Tons of effects and options of what you can do with your video, fonts, stickers and etc. My only problem is that there is a bug with the stickers where the loop animation won’t process at times and I will have to find a way around it, other then that it’s amazing and I highly suggest you get it if your hard of understanding like me! I also adore the variety in about everything; tons of stickers for you to use and you can also import your own, multiple edits you can use on your video, tons of fonts you can choose and all of it is very easy to understand."
5,AmyAndTucket,"This app is absolutely awesome. I have made so many cool edits with my brother and quarantine friends. This app has legit saved me from boredom 1000 times. It has cool effects and great quality too. Me and my friends made a music video to the “Ai Ai Ai, I’m your little butterfly” song. And since CapCut has the “remove background” button (that is free) we could make my friends little brother sour through the sky.... like a little butterfly lol. I would also recommend this to people who vlog. Between the awesome effects and translation, you can make pro edits! You can also make Gacha stories with it. The only thing I would recommend tho is more anime-ish sound effects and effects. I also would suggest longer songs, maybe real ones that are popular but I understand due to copyright. Yeah, other than that great app! ✌️😁"
5,night ninja kite,"CapCut is a great app, but I think they need to update the key frames a bit and add more effects. I love how you can get rid of the watermark FOF FREE. I think the texts needs a bit more animations like vs but other then that you could consider them alike besides the less work. I think CapCut does need to let you do some of the work on your own, if that makes sense. CapCut is a good app for beginners, I think they should add stuff like making your own effect and what not, like how people will give you tutorials on flashing with the white overlays. I don't know why people think CapCut isn’t a good editing app, I think it may be the part where you don’t have to do much, as in you don’t put in much hard work. I think it would be cool to give tutorials on how to make your own effects, animations, shakes, etc."
5,FourFerralCats,"i have been using capcut for a long time now, and overall i genuinely love it. It’s my favorite editing app, and i feel as if it provides the most freedom out of other apps that i have seen. However, I have two suggestions. One, when adding music, to be able to import from your device’s files. I save a lot of music as mp3s from an audio program, so i think it would just be a lot easier if there was one more way to import. Another suggestion I have is to be able to turn off snapping without exiting the editor. Maybe on the overlay screen, there can be a button near the undo-redo feature where you can turn snapping on and off. Either way, I love the app so much and those are just two things that would make it so much easier to use."
4,it's me jay,"Hi creators of CapCut. I absolutely love this app. It’s the best and easiest editing app I ever downloaded. It makes it a lot easier for someone who barely knows how to do transitions. I don’t think I would change anything except one thing. So earlier I was making an edit for my fan page and I wanted to add a graph but it wasn’t letting me get any of the choices. Then I searched it up and saw that this option only works for androids which I don’t think is fair at all. Most people I know that have this is app is iPhone users, such as myself, don’t think it’s fair. So if it’s not too much trouble can you make it possible for iPhone users to use the graph option plus I updated the app and everything and it’s still not working. But other than that I love this app and can’t wait for other things you add to it.   Sincerely, CapCut editor/user."
4,Emma_Rose5970,"So my dream was to become a gachatuber but I knew that would never happen. So about 2 months ago I went to my friends b-day party and another one of my friends were  there. She brought her phone and was like “look I can make gacha videos.” So i was like “HOW?!?” And she told me get CapCut so I wemt home amd did that. I was expecting it to be awful like the other ones. But no.. I LOVED IT!!!! I made a lot of gacha life vids with it!!! So it fixed my dream of becoming a gachatuber. I don’t need to post it, i can just make it and feel good about myself 🫢. But the problem is the templates. I am still looking for one I used already because you have to reset them to get different ones. And they are all called popular or pop. It’s so annoying that I can’t find that one template. BUT THE REST IS GREAT. I just take screenshots and it makes a vid. So that’s my opinion!!!"
5,wood 17,"I’ve tried multiple editing apps for my phone and by far, this has been the most advanced app. CapCut features more filters, tools, and effects than I could ever imagine I needed. There are so many tools to make your work the most professional and fit any genre. Some apps I’ve tried, distort the audio when exporting or crash right in the middle of editing but I haven’t experienced this at all. There’s everything from music and audio to stickers and filters and all sorts of visuals that make videos very enticing and fun. If you’re looking for an editing app, this is the best one. I’m 13 and have managed my way around the app just fine. Nothing confusing at all. I just keep finding new features to improve my work every time I edit something new.  I’m very impressed"
4,CreeksShordan,"Totally free, great animation options, super easy to learn and use. Compared to all the other apps I’ve used this one by far exceeds them in nearly every category. The only complaint I’d have is when I add all my effects, animations, etc the app begins to glitch. Particularly with masking, when i try to playback the edit to check the timing it glitches, slows, freezes, or sometimes even crashes completely. I’m not sure if it’s just a system overload, but I rarely make anything longer than 1.5 minutes. It can be frustrating not being able to check my work without having to save the video to watch it or shut the app down before it is finished. Other than that, I’d love more effects/being able to alter the timing of the effects. But honestly, it is still my go-to and for being 100% free this app is stellar! Love it."
5,Alisa🌴,"My absolute favorite and all time used editing app!💗 Love it so much! I really love how developers are adding new features like the video effects one and so on. It would be much more more awesome and beneficial for the users if the developers by any way can make new transitions! Just an idea- There should be an option about if the user wanna make their edits by using all ready made transitions or if they wanna make new transitions by their own! It would be an absolute banger then!🥰 Also, it would be really great if the quality can increase a bit. Whenever I post it in Instagram, it’s quality is ruined. Even if I save it to photos the quality isn’t that much good but if posting in Instagram it’s worst. Either ways, love the app! Perfect and awesome for beginners! Can’t get over it🖤 I absolutely recommend it!💗"
5,(●ﾟωﾟ●)𝙷𝙸,"Well, this app isn’t used often by gachatubers, but I am one of them. I struggle with trying to animate and tween, but with CapCut, it’s so easy! It has tons of effects, and it has everything! I made an Intro, in less than 30 minutes, with this app. I showed it to my little sister, and she loved the music on there too. It’s easy to work too. It has tons of stickers and options! You can do text and audio, and text is one of my favorites. You can pick an animation for it. Wavy, wobbly, shaky, etc. When you use overlay, (overlay is basically what I always use lol. ) overlay has options after you put in the picture. You can animate it. It doesn’t require tweening at all! I haven’t seen people always use this app, but they should! I love this app a lot! Please get it!"
5,sasquatchmaster32,This app is so cool!!! I love how it is free and you don’t have to pay for anything inside the app. I have some suggestions though… I wish that when you are adding a clip and you go to the ones that are provided you can actually change the text like the sugar babe clip for example: you click on it and put it in your video but no one wants a clip that says”sugar babe” on it and they just want the fancy animation with the word that they want to put on it. I really hope you can change that up if possible. I also wish that when you select the neon  thing so it outlines people with neon in your video that it just outlines them and doesn’t have fancy words pop out and boxed text because it ruins the video. This app is amazing and I hope you can take my ideas into consideration.
1,sport1245,In capcut I was editing for a tiktok video to get a lot of likes tho and it was fun for me….to edit some people but something hapenned…..one day…I got to capcut cause I wanted to edit some people against cause I like to edit them to the people but when I put to make a video or idk?it says delete some of you videos and I’m like ok it’s easy so I delete some and still says that delete some cause it’s full and then I erased all of them and I clicked the edit to edit some video and then something happened…well It stills say it’s full videos but I erased them all..I didn’t have videos cause I erased it so yeah and haved 0 videos cause erased u know right? It haven to some people and I dis install the app capcut and go to the App Store and download it against and me have to wait and another day I checked and it wasn’t there the app as installed so I wait the other day and still and still I waited like 5 days and still I don’t know what to do with this tho now what should I do if I cannot get the app back forever and ever
4,hElLoOOoO00000hhh,"CapCut is an easy app and I use it for a ton of stuff, it’s perfect for beginners, or pros. I love that everything is free so I don’t have to pay 50 dollars a month just to get some special effects. But there is a new glitch where when I join CapCut, it switches my screen and makes it vertical, not horizontal. I have never had this problem til a couple weeks ago, and the only way to fix it is if I leave the app (not deleting the tab) and then join again. But one of my favorite parts is the watermark. There is no watermark and you can just delete the ending. I usually keep it so people know how amazing capcut is, but if you hate having a huge watermark on your videos use capcut!  Other than that the app is great! I just hope that issue can get fixed, and would totally recommend this app to fellow editors!"
5,Guy that wants to know,"There is no exaggeration when I say that I’ve deleted every other video app on my phone. This app has everything they have and more, all for free. Some apps don’t even let you test out their other effects and other things without buying their subscription, this app is filled with loads of effects and transitions and so much more all for free and I didn’t know there could be a mobile app like this, it’s the After Effects of mobile devices. This review may seem fake or something but I can guarantee you that the reason for this positive feedback is that I make edits on Instagram and have been looking for a way to make my edits when I’m not home or on my pc. Good work to the creators, Ive shared this with others and will continue to do so!"
4,hanjisinvisiblewife,So I started using this app about three months ago and I really like it I really like the develops and updates of this app I think it is very helpful for me in my editing I had to come on here because I really just wanna say thank you has built-in sticker is in the built-in all these effects that are just amazing and I really do want to thank you Guys So my issue is whenever I am eventually editing and there will be like a problem where it will start lagging and I know this is happened with a few people I don’t know if it’s happened with everyone but I’ll eventually start liking and my and it won’t be as smooth anymore I don’t know if that’s the app itself or I’m just doing something completely wrong but can someone really fix this or tell me what I’m doing wrong because I really need this app to be in my life right now haha
4,RE__NA🖤,"This is a really good editing app! I LOVE it and it’s completely free plus it has no watermark which is so good and it’s pretty simple to work with however, there is a few things that I don’t love about it.  1. They affects is a little bit bad quality. Also, the bling effects are kinda weird. Again I still love this app but this could be improved 2. The transitions aren’t AS smooth as I’d hope but it’s a completely free editing app so what do you expect?  3. I don’t know if it does it to everyone’s edits but it makes mine turn out grainy / bad quality. That might just be mine though.  I love this app and if those things were improved I’d love it even more but overall it’s such a good, free, watermarkless (😂) editing app that I would recommend getting if you don’t wanna pay for an app! 😁"
3,meeks2001,"So, Editing a video is so easy. We can all agree on that. But it lags really bad. If you do many pictures or even if you do three pictures it will lag. I was editing a video, Only two pictures with an overlay. My audio kept glitching out. A couple hours later i wanted to see if it was still like that, and to my surprise it was. Usually when it lags i close out of the app and wait a couple mins,, This app is my main editing app. I do understand that apps do have glitches and lags,,but this is somewhat weird and should only happen a couple times. But this has happened as soon as i downloaded the app. When i downloaded the app it was very laggy and wouldnt let me delete anything. I deleted the app and re-downloaded it,,,it got way worse. And i dont want to delete it again because it shows my process and how much i have gotten better. Please fix the glitches"
5,xpenal,"Omg, this app is just amazing. I love roblox and gacha life and this is the best app to edit them with! It’s so easy to use and has so many cool effects! My most favorite part, it’s free! Not a single effect I use cost a single penny. I am so I love with this app omg. Though I was wishing there where other things. Like is there any way to add effects over the overlayed image/video? It only goes all the way to the back. Also, can there be a effect to make the movement smooth? What I mean by that is, when you make a video and the character/person moves around like the movement to smoothen out. That would be pretty cool. Just a suggesting though! Other than that, like I said, I LOVEEEEE THIS APP! It’s almost like videostar actually but all the good things are free! Thanks for making this app! It’s so useful!"
5,Oly707,"luckily capcut isn't a gold digger like some other editing apps, it has several free effects and options that make your edit expensive without buying anything. for an example, video star is good alone. but MANY people have bought pro, and it's 100% better. unlike that, capcut is great free too! i do have to admit it was pretty plain in the past, but they've added GRAPHS and new effects, which really improves the app. i especially love the 3D effects, they're so realistic and fascinating! plus capcut isn't confusing at all, the main reason i drop most editing apps is because they're confusing. even days after trying to get the hang of it, if i can't, then i delete it. but capcut is very easy to understand and get the hang of, i really recommended it!"
4,Spinny28,To start of this I would like to say this app is super easy to use while giving you flawless work if you know how to use it. It is free and simple and easy to understand. Though I have become a good editor a problem is now occurring. The problem is that when I try to download it and share to my friends the work I made isn’t on beat which is more important down the line of editing. Though I have checked many times if this was my fault It proceeded to fail even though I have  tried a different method of recording and sending it. I know for a fact that it isn’t me but the software. So if you are sending your edits to friend and have the problem to spread awareness. Thank you so Caput for making me such a good editor though and I hope to see more success in the future.
4,sumangryteen,"I wanna start off saying I love this app. It has many features and editing skills that I love and couldn’t live without in my day to day life, honestly. However, I can’t give it a full 5 star rating because recently, for about a month now, none of my effects, the question mark at the top of the screen, or anything else have been working. I’ve looked up solutions but can’t find anything other than the app being banned in India. I don’t live in India! This is an issue for me because I can’t even report the problem to the app due to “No internet connection”, which I am connected to. All of my other apps work just fine too. I would love to give five stars, but I don’t know how to fix this. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you. :)"
5,Julby89,"First of all, this app is the BEST! It has so many stickers, effects, fonts, and much more! I was a very beginner at editing but I improved a LOT by just this app. Overall, it’s great! Love it!  But there are some problems too. I’m not saying the app is bad but it’s kind of annoying when I go into the app(in mobile) and it just appears as vertical and I need to turn my device to make it horizontal. Please try to fix that. A suggestions is that I think you need a bit more music to add because there’s not a lot of choices plus I can’t get the music I want. Maybe add a search bar at the top and some similar things like that. (Maybe the music from Apple Music?).  I hope these wishes for CapCut come true so you can make it even better! Good luck!"
5,clulessasif,"Greetings, Capcut creator. I am very pleased to say that this app is amazing! Absolutely worth my time. Making edits on this app is so fun and it never takes me too long. The no watermark really helps because I don’t want to waste money on an editing app just to remove something.  But I have suggestions to make this app even better even though you might not see this. A- Fonts   Now we have a lot of great fonts in this app, although I feel like we could use more Sans Serif or just Serif fonts to make it more regular but to really step it up. Frankly, you can use the different language fonts in English sentences, I feel like to make our editing jobs more modern we could use more round, and bubbly fonts.   Example: Champagne & Limousines, Blacklisted, and etc.  B- Animation     Don’t get me wrong, the animations on this app are everything. Even better than most transitional animations. However, I feel as though we need graphs to make our own video animations. Font animations are okay, but I feel like it’d be cooler to add the same animations for the fonts as the pictures have.  -Sincerely,           Anonymous P.S. - I know this update would take a while, but you’d benefit off of it. Trust me xx"
5,i.Amiro.i,"Hi , Hope you’re staying safe, I’m a professional video editor and I’ve been editing video with Adobe premiere for something about 10 years , But last year when I installed CapCut for a test to edit a video I realized that What a amazing app I was missing , So it’s been 1 year now that I’m editing mu videos with CapCut & I can say this is really Amazing and powerful ! Even better than a pc software like Adobe premiere ! Because CapCut is much easier , Faster and more professional to use ! .... You’re app is amazing but I have a advice that I think it can help CapCut to be better , , I think it will be really great if you guys add a ( Font-adding ) option in Text section so users be able to add their own fonts to app , It will be really great !!!"
5,clushiflushi,"Ok. CapCut is SUCH AN AMAZING APP! The transitions.. dude, ITS UNIQUE! :D But.. please :( add more transitions, please??? I know there is a lot of transitions but add some more to (in) transitions and (out) transitions. The (out) transitions are kinda good but it needs more. Only in my opinion tho- also I don’t know but please add more and rework to voice affects. Plsssss? Some of the voices sound a little a like. And the chipmunk one sounds a little distorted because of a background noise? Idk if it’s the voice that’s being distorted. And the “distorted” voice doesn’t really sound distorted. It’s just a really low pitched voice- :< also add more voice changers, for example it’s distorted, kinda like and alien but it’s wavy voice, and add like bass booted, auto tune, and others :D would love that, anyways great app :)"
4,vhgcvvdgdwdrfvq,"I love this app! It’s a great beginner app if you’re just getting into editing and it’s also great if you’re more advanced! I’ve been editing for 9 months and I can constantly find new things to try and different editing techniques all on a completely FREE (yes, there are NO in app purchases!) app! I do have a few suggestions tho! 1) better audio capabilities. This app doesn’t have many things to do with audio, maybe add some better voice changers? The sound also doesn’t get very loud so that’s a bummer:/ 2) split screen templates! There are ways to do split screens but you have to completely do it from scratch so it’s a bit of a hassle. It also is very hard to do if you’re a beginner so this is something I would very much enjoy! Overall I highly recommend this app!"
5,maizy_pearl,I love this app so much and the best app they just added new Slomo I don’t even know how to explain this is the best app I definitely. Suggest you get this app and if you love to edit then this is the app for you I’ve had this app for two years and I love it so far you guys should definitely get it💝 this app is the best thing that happened to me in my life since I love to edit my friend told me about this app so I got it and I became addicted I just can’t explain how much I love this app it’s literally the best and if you do end up getting it and you like it then you said tell your friends about it it took me a while to to learn how to use the app but I watched some tutorials and it definitely helped me but this is it for the review just telling you guys you should get it
5,SchweetQuartz,"I’ve been using Capcut for a few months now and I’d say its my go to editing app! The fact that it’s absolutely free and super easy to use makes it a lot less complicated for beginner editors. I’d just like to suggest a few things that I have issues with. One thing for sure is to add graphs so the key frames look a lot smoother and better. Secondly, adding some more fonts and animations for the texts. I think there should be in and out animations for the loops texts so I don’t have to save it separately to add it in. And maybe let users make custom animations too? Its just my opinion, but I think the app will be a lot more compatible if that was added in. Overall the app is great and I hope that the developers see my opinions for upcoming updates :]"
5,gsheteiewowudgej,"Capcut is amazing! I use capcut to make a lot of edits and funny skits. With capcut, most of the magic and aliveness comes from the editing. At first, I was very puzzled on capcut, considering I switched from IMovie, which is a great app. But I eventually came into turns with it, and now capcut is really easy to edit with. They have a ton of effects, transitions, and you can crop your videos and manage volume. There is so much more, but it’s a lot to explain. It would be all good things though. Even though I am great full for managing how to edit in capcut, I feel some people might have some trouble with editing because there is a lot of things you can do and people might be confused. Other than that, I love this app so much and I continue to make new edits everyday!"
2,AriesKat7,"I’ve had capcut for awhile now. There has been new effects/tools that I have been very excited to use.  Right as that happens, a terrible glitch comes marching in. Any time you click on filter, animation, effects, graphs, literally anything besides your photo album it says, “ No internet connection. Try connecting to the internet and try again. “ Even if I’m connected to the internet, it doesn’t work. I’ve tried reinstalling it, looking at tutorials, etc. I may be just blind while looking at this kind of stuff but I cannot find another way to make this work without installing a VPN or Proxy. Proxy’s are dangerous, and VPNS don’t work because their “ not safe “ according to my IPad. And who wants to turn it on every time their using capcut? This is ridiculous. It ruins the entire point of capcut. I can’t find another way to report this glitch so I’m writing it in a review. Thank you."
4,hasabeaineboofan,Yes I love this app it’s amazing for fan edits and I love it the only thing I hate abt this is it takes up so much storage for no reason like I delete all my edits and deleted all the music in the app deleted all my templates even went into setting and all that I could see the was the documents and data and I think the app picks up what I do online or something like that cause that’s all I can think of I’m not blaming CapCut saying they’re doing that but that it like there nothing in the app or they just remember all the music and videos you made and collect that and keep it and it just stays like that even after they’re deleted. So yeah I loved using this and still would love using it if it wasn’t for how much storage it takes up cause i only have 32 gigabytes. Lol
5,deneike,"I use it on every video I have to edit it brings the features you need for videos I didn’t know until I really try it myself it’s best for all video edits until now am in love with the app it has every mood you want for example your in a sad mood and you want to edit a video about you being sad Capcut has it all happy, sad, bored everything. I’ve been using the app for over a year.  What I like most about the app is that it free you don’t have to pay for unlimited there is nothing like that other apps you need to pay unlimited to use special features and effects but Capcut has what the other apps want you to pay for.  Capcut is the best recommended for people who like to edit videos or to make videos it’s the best."
4,Idk but I need a name,"Overall this app is good for beginner editors! I love that everything is 100% free because I really don’t want to pay for a professional editing app. However, there’s only so much you can do with CapCut since everything consists of presets. It would be great if you could include options to make your own transitions, mask layers, animations, and import fonts. I also find it very frustrating that you can’t use combo and in/out animations at the same time for text and you can’t use animations on effects. The velocity/speed settings are also very glitchy and don’t create smooth videos. These are just a few suggestions that I really hope you take into consideration. Again, I do like this app but I’ll probably move on to a more complex software that gives me more creative freedom."
5,Ads at the end,"This is an amazing app, updates are incredible. I just love the feeling of people doing Roblox edits, they turn out so good that it inspires me to do some (only a few are successful:D) so here is some of the experience:D I don't like the quality of the screen I use because I use an iPad, please add an option to change the screen size to fill:D it just makes the quality easier for my videos! Also, add some more cute filters. (This part of the section is NOT ME hating on the filters) I just don't feel like there could be enough beautiful filters and if you can add some more updates to Shortcut and that would be amazing! Sorry if this is short but amazing app ❤️❤️❤️❤️ recommend it for beginners, anyway, that's all! Bye"
5,okk_kkk,"This app is very easy to use and a very nice tool to make a montage or anything you would really want to edit. I just have one problem, when deleting a video on capcut, I think you should add a recently deleted feature where all your deleted clips/videos are there and you can recover it just like when you accidentally delete a photo on the photos app. If you could add this feature it would mean a lot to me. I am a very clumsy person and recently I have been deleting a lot of clips that I do not want deleted (because i want to save storage) but most of the time I usually delete the videos I am editing. Please respond to this review and add the feature! Thank you!"
5,Mozzerwannabe,"I am an amateur filmmaker and I work only on FCPX, it’s been my learning platform and I’ve really enjoyed my experience with it! But, I always wished I could add more to my videos… different animations, filters, etc. I was making a fan edit for a friend as a joke and in trying to find the app to do that, I found this one. Literally have only used it for a day and it’s already changed my life. It has every special effect I’ve wanted to add to my past videos available… FOR FREE. Honestly, this app has pulled me out of my long term editing block and now, IM DYING to makes new one so I can use all the cool features this app offers. To all the hard working people out there who made this app, thank you, you guys are really cool."
5,THEBOYSRULE,"This thing is a literal powerhouse. This editor has many customizable text styles, many stickers, multiple layers, all that jazz. The one thing that makes CapCut stand out from the rest is that it’s 100% FREE! No in-app purchases, no monthly subscriptions, no ads, no watermarks, no NOTHING. Seriously, what else can you ask for?  However, when I export certain stickers, the app just crashes, and the video doesn’t save to my camera roll. I tried multiple times, same thing, over and over again. Nope, just crashes. I really hope this gets fixed soon.  Overall, I would recommend this app for mobile content creators. If you are looking for a mobile editing app, you’ve came to the right place."
5,Nixo1,"For beginners these is extremely intelligent to start for an app, experience also helps a lot but that is for more advanced. Honestly, capcut is pretty good for advanced as well! Quick and short for promising edits! I got this app when I was 9-10 I am now 12! And I love this app so much it is incredibly useful! At first I was so confused, but seeing these talented editors kept me pushing to be as great as them! I now personally think I am awesome at editing, I have posted edits of mine before but I mostly like to keep them to myself, which still brings me pleasure! Every time I watch them to myself it still makes me happy, I’ve never upgraded to a higher editing app, because capcut, still learns some how to keep the vets to stay<3"
4,Kristee1221,"Ok, I have been using this app to edit for about 2 or 3 months now. I’ve gotten the hang of most of the stuff. But there’s a ton of things that can make the app better. Like being able to put multiple translations, and graphs. I know some of the transitions already come with motion blur but it would be so cool to have the option if we wanted to add motion blur or not. Also I’m gonna mention graphs again because they would make the app a lot better to use for editing. A lot of people also want graphs not just me. Something else that would be awesome Is you know the effect that is called camera focus 2 I believe? Well if there could be one where it clears the picture more quickly that would be great! Other then that the app is overall a great beginner editing app."
4,A guy righting reviews,Realistically this app deserves five stars but there’s one problem I keep having with this app I don’t know of other people have been having this problem too or if I’m just going crazy but for some reason every once in a while when I upload a video from my camera roll through CapCut all of the audio my voice goes away the games audio stays it’s just my voice that goes but when I check my video in my actual camera roll my microphone was on and you can hear me speaking up for some reason the CapCut just completely gets rid of my voice which is kind of annoying because I’m YouTuber and this is the editing software I used to make my videos and until this gets fixed CapCut is gonna stay at a 4 star from me
5,okay123678,"All my friends have downloaded a app called CapCut. I didn’t know what it was and it seemed really cool because you can make these really great edits on TikTok! So, I downloaded it myself to try it out and to be honest at first I was so bad at it I thought I might just delete it. But my friend told me to not delete it and that it would get easier if I tried. I grew to love the app so much! I have so many more followers on TikTok and likes, sometimes I just like to make a edits in the car when I’m bored. I think it’s pretty good the way it is and a lot of people have been asking for different fonts, OK here’s my theory... YOU ONLY NEED ONE! Do you see if you post it on TikTok you can put different fonts on it there. Have a great rest of your day or night!❤️"
5,kdubbeybkader,This is the best easiest editing app ever it’s better than tempo better than vinkle better than video star well video star u can edit really good but it’s really hard it’s it’s better than viva cut and plus it’s 100% free no water marks no paying everything free and u have stickers text like I don’t know the name of all the things but it’s really good if ur a beginner and if u master it I’m pretty sure your going to stay on the app but CapCut it would be waaaaaaay over the best if it added that u can can change the color of things in effect and especially party because they have hot pink and red alert but I would like it if u added color changing to those or something but yes I highly recommend this app it’s the best
5,Llama_ICE BEAR,"CapCut is so far my favorite editing app. The layout and tools are simple and efficient, making this perfect for beginners/quick edits. But this doesn't make it low-quality. In fact, I've been using CapCut for 2 years now and have gotten great feedback from others. Another high is the CapCut watermark is out of the way, only showing up towards the end of the video. I would totally recommend CapCut to people with somewhat powerful devices.   One minor problem is the app can get extremely laggy and slow. For example, if I moved an on-screen item I might have to wait a fat minute for it to actually move. This can get in the way of usage of keyframes. Other than this, CapCut is pretty great!"
5,LynxxOfficial,"This is by far, the best editing app that I have come across. I would like to suggest some features for the upcoming update. Shadows and strokes for overlays, speed for text, more animations for text and possibly animations for overlays. (For ex. a softer shake loop animation, jiggle loop animation but instead horizontally or both or all directions) possibly more shaking effects or jiggle effects for the actual video footage(again, possibly multiple directions). I would like speed for keyframes, (and a way to control the speed and see the speed). Also, is there a way for you to be able to add an in animation, a loop animation, and an out animation for text at the same time? Last, please add a feature where you can add your own text."
4,sghsshbs,"hello stranger that is reading this ! before you download the app please read this , I personally love cap cut . It helps me with a lot of stuff for example if I’m editing a photo at the beach or one of my tiktok Roblox videos it’s awesome ! I love all the cool effects on this app but it can cause a little bit of trouble depending on what device your using to edit    .... If your a person who doesn’t really care for small differences on the quality of apps then this is just right for you ! It has many cool features you can even add your favorite music to your edits I’ve only had it for about 2 weeks and only had a little bit of trouble . Many people use this app and currently I love everything about it <33 thank you for reading dear gal/boi and I recommend this app to everyone 😗✌🏼"
5,Wavewasher,"I am literally in love with this app. I made so many edits and videos by using this. There are so many things you can do in this app! So many different combinations you can choose from and make your videos unique. Although, I have 2 small requests that would make this better  1. I love making AMVs but when I insert GIFs, it just becomes a photo from a random scene in a GIF. I would really appreciate if you would let GIFs actually be GIFs instead of just photos  2. It would be cool if you could change the pitch without changing the speed. I also like making cosplay videos with music in the background and I like to make it look like the character is singing it. But, there are only so many versions of a song you can find on the internet. If you don’t get what I mean, take the song Control for example. All the male covers of the song is high and the character I’m relating to has a deep voice. I made the video slower, but I can’t make it too slow or it would look weird. I hope that makes sense.  Other than that, I would defiantly recommend this app, 10/10!"
5,Erynscoldroof7,"If you are new to editing this would be a perfect editing app to start with or stay with. I have just stuck with CapCut but I am thinking of using other apps after I check out there reviews.  I like CapCut I have been using it for a long time to make my edits. There are a couple glitches but they don’t effect ur edit. I wish they would add new transitions, like where it blurs the whole video and not just behind the “object”. CapCut has really been updated since I got it! Also they should update the filters, some of them are kinda just well um crazy…                 But anyways I really like CapCut and I would suggest it to all editors!     Have a nice day random person who read this."
5,☆мєя¢у☆,"Hello! Never really make reviews so I apologize in advance if what I’m saying is either vague or not specific 😅.  The app, overall my favorite. It’s very quick and easy to use and I’ve been using it for a couple months. Since the recent update though, there’s been a bug that I rely on. One being the stickers. They don’t seem to load, as for the transitions do the same. Whenever I tap on a grey square (what the sticker icons look like) sometime it would load the ones I’ve previously put in a clip, but not the ones that I haven’t. They show up saying that I need to check my connection. I deleted and reinstalled the app and that didn’t do anything but lose clips :/. Thanks if you are reading this!"
5,Moonxs :),"CapCut is the best editing app l have ever used l like how everything is free! I been using this app for about 2 years! But l do think it could use some changes! So yea these are my suggestions you could maybe add in CapCut? : if there was a 3D button? My edits need these! It would make the app 10X better! And maybe add like more animations! And if there was a custom animation? That would be really cool! Maybe add some more stickers but overall the app is really good ! If you would add those three things that would be great! But it’s okay if not! But yea it’s really easy to use,make a edit. And l love that it has a short cut to make a edit? And there alot of temples! So yea overall 5 stars! I recommend this app! 👍😁❤️✨👋🏻"
4,adrilouh1143,"So, I decided to write this review for a few reasons. One, I’ve been getting the “No internet connection.” for like 4 days now? I have VPN and everything! Everything else is working perfectly fine! If it’s a bug, or anything..please fix it! Two, It’s easy to understand, but maybe for newer editors, give them a tutorial? I’m not sure if you guys already have one, but…that would be helpful! Just a recommendation! Well, I guess that’s it. Overall, this is a wonderful app! I use it so much! Keep up the updates and awesome work! I’ve used it to edit so many videos and the results come out great!!! Again, please try fixing this weird bug, or whatever it is…I’m not sure if it’s just me, though. Haha. Anyways, thank you for reading, developers! 😃"
5,XxAlex_Afton_Xx✨🧋🥲,"Best editing software I’ve had! But many bugs :( Yesterday my sound stopped working on capcut… I’ll make it specific on what I’m saying. Last year I filmed my friends birthday, and it was one of my favorite videos, but yesterday, the sound stopped working! I tried muting it then muting it again, turning my iPad off then on again, and then updating my iPad, but nothing worked… and lots of my other videos don’t have sound either! Please fix this bug because I miss the sounds to my videos :( and I waited till today to see if it got fixed but it didn’t! Please fix this bug! It’s annoying and I want my sounds back! If that gets fixed I’ll be very happy and satisfied, please fix it!"
3,bridgetttttt_t,"i’ve had capcut for a few months now and i’ve noticed a few things that are wrong with the app. first, there’s no graphs. it’s all premade transitions. The keyframes are almost useless. Nothing is smooth. If you do use keyframes, it looks horrible. Second, you have no coloring section. And they’re all premade. So I can’t make my own coloring. And finally, your speed settings. The slomotion is SO laggy, it makes me want to ball my eyes out. And your app is really only used for velocity’s, and there is t even a smooth slomo. I loved capcut because I wanted to become an editor, but I didn’t have the money to pay so much money every few months. And it all made sense, but it was so different from any other editing app. There isn’t even motion blur (tracking). So, if there’s any way you can fix these problems, it would be a great app."
4,bakudekuisbestship,"There’s a bug that needs to be fixed. When using an animation, the animation doesn’t do the whole video/ picture, making it reset to its original posture and making it look weird. I thought that I needed to update the app but noticed it’s been updated two days ago. It was working fine not long ago, I think the update messed it up or smth, idk. But the animations aren’t working. I even did a new project to see if it would work again or even resetting it, but nope, still doesn’t work. Hope it can get fixed asap, before my motivations leave. But take your time, no rush :) Update: I really wanna use CapCut but it looks ugly :(  Update 2: Ugh!! It did it to one of my other projects! Please get it fixed quickly, Im this close to exploding 🤏"
4,✨jadyn✨,"So I really love that everything is free and it has great transitions but it’s like really glitchy.. like when I’m making a really long edit and I need to watch what I’ve got so far to see if I like it, it glitches a lot and gets froze while I’m watching it. I don’t know if it’ll be better once I save it but... also, when I save photos from like google it only shows some of them it doesn’t show all of them when I have it on the setting that it shows all of my photos. But other then that I really like the app it’s just a bit glitchy and maybe needs an update but overall it’s a really good app and I recommend it especially if you have a hard time figuring out how to work apps it’s super easy to access everything and yea it’s a good app."
4,Staytinymultistan,"So I’ve been using this since I’ve started editing, I heard of it on TikTok and decided to try it out. It works really nice, this is the easiest app to manage out of all the others I’ve tried like vllo, video star, and inshot (for me anyway). The only issue I found that kind of made me want to use another app is the fact that I made a video that was 43 seconds long (for TikTok) but when I exported it into my camera roll it only said 42 seconds. Why is this? I tried editing my video, making it shorter and then longer, deleting my other projects, etc but nothing seemed to fix the problem that when exported into my camera roll it slowed my video down by one second, therefore the transitions were slowed. Can someone help please? Thank you."
3,kdkdmdododmldldkdkd,Why I love it: why i love it is cuz you can edit and all types of stuff it helped me editing I know how to screen record and it is awesome you have to update it to make the pic move which is not a problem! I can also share which makes me happy cuz I can show edits to my cousins me and my cousin edit with each other we love to see what we make   Why I hate it:it says to delete storage over and over again and if I don’t I can’t edit idk why that is a thing but I HATE it. It makes me mad and I just wanna delete the app it’s kinda laggy to which I hate or it’s my iPad or WiFi I also hate it because you can use it without WiFi but no animations! I know I can use it at home but still it makes me mad I just wanna edit and edit sometimes I have to watch tutorials but not a problem but besides that it’s awesome!❤️
4,me twoooo,"Capcut is one of the best phone editing apps out there in my opinion! It’s perfect for making instagram edits or any type of video, but there are some things that could be added to make this app even more better and useable. I would like to see more masking options and shapes for the masking tool, and more transitions that are subtle but also very smooth. Transitions for the cubes that are simple like going up and down/or side to side would be nice as well! Capcut has so much potential, it just needs more added to its already great platform! I would love to see more filters, but mostly more transitions and masking options! Thank you for reading my review hopefully if the developers see this they consider my request."
5,Michelle674D,"It has almost been a year, since I’ve been using this app. It all started in Mid-January, at the time I was new to editing so wanted to try something new. And that’s when I was introduced to CapCut. When I went on there, the app was okay, and showed me the steps I needed to make my videos really fun/epic. So here are a few improvements I think you guy should make, first of all, when you done making a video- (an edit) or whatsoever, can you make and attempt NOT to tell us to exit out of the app, because my phone can sometimes have trouble functioning, so it’s either life or death here. But overall I think everything is good, and keep improving! ❤️"
5,my love of life,"i’ve been editing with capcut for a good while, but im lacking some stuff in the capcut app, this is just a PLEASE add this to your app if you can!  1: graphs i’ve been doing some edits on the app. safe to say, its really easy to make edits and super fun with all the effects, filters, keyframes, etc. but, making an edit with only keyframes is way too hard. a simple transition can take up to an hour to succeed with no graphs. please, add graphs.  2: overlay limit when i make edits or try animating with characters, the overlay limit can make me miss a leg or any other body part. i recommend to make the overlay limit unlimited since its way too hard having to keep exporting and all that and eventually having to use another program.  3: the lag there’s an intense amount of lag if you add a few effects, overlays, or simple texts. and i’d really love if you fix the issue  4: off timing i’ve had this issue editing for someone a video with only subtitles, the subtitles would be on time in the app but out of the app its off time (slightly) and its very confusing. please fix this.  that’s all, thank you!"
5,iiaesthetixcherryz,Ok so I got this at first I didn’t get it then I got used to it getting it more and more now thanks to this app I have more followers I want to thank you for making this app because it has saved my life I started using this app when I started tik tok now this has became the best app ever existing I add my own music and I sometimes do edits and take them on CapCut and add some effects so they shine more there is nothing wrong with this app its amazing the way it is and the animation is so cool it helps me with my edits I’m so glad I got this app it saved my life I spend some of my time making little stuff but with a lot of effects and animation cuz it’s so cool for me I rate this five starts to the best app every created in history🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🥳🎊🎉❤️
4,Xx-biscuits-xX,"I already reviewed but I would like to edit it because I have complaints. I like CapCut and it’s great to use but I don’t know if this is just my device or a glitch on the app. When i use the text box, it won’t let me choose any fonts anymore other than “SELECT”. It used to, but not anymore. I was not happy about that but eventually just dealt it. Then, a few weeks later, I couldn’t choose different colors for the font anymore. It kinda froze the font stuff only. I haven’t checked the animations for fonts yet, though. Anyways, I don’t like having only the “SELECT” font and having to be stuck with pink as a color font. Again, this might only be my device, but if not, please fix this! Thank you 🙏"
3,um da best,"This app is good, mostly because it’s free and stuff. And you can basically do whatever you want on here. But here are my problems. As you know, most people on TikTok use this app to edit for their edit accounts. But, as I see i’m better apps, such as VideoStar, they have all these cool effects and stuff that people on Capcut don’t get. Not to mention some of the buttons working in and out at random times. I had to reverse a clip for an edit but it did not reverse and told me to “try again”. I did and it didn’t work. I had to re-download the WHOLE app entirely over this glitch. And other buttons don’t work as well, either. Please fix this lr I promise you, people will just pay the short amount it is for VideoStar and other apps like AE and will not use this platform to edit. <3"
5,udureueueuddjxjxxcc,The app is overall extremely simple and can edit very effectively. Is it possible that in a future update we could have a more powerful green screen filter with the chrome key? The current one is not that advanced and I still see some green and some glitches. I would even pay to have a premium version of it. I feel that this is the main thing that the app lacks. Also if there could be equalizing and white noise cancellation for audio. These things would make me love the app even more. But overall very good and thanks to the CapCut team for working hard on their updates. The app is amazing.
4,FrenchFryAddict,"This app is great whether you have experiencing editing or you’re new to the process. My biggest frustration with it, is when I send in high resolution videos from my iPhone to my iPad it seems to convert it to a lower resolution. Even if I up it to 2K/4K on CapCut.   Additionally, it would be a great benefit if the app would sync across all devices. That may solve the aforementioned issue if I could upload the video on my iphone and then pick up the editing on the iPad. The only reason I’m sharing this feedback here, is because there’s nowhere else to send feedback to the app to ask for assistance. Which would be my third complaint.  Outside of that, this app is super powerful for being free! I highly suggest downloading and using this app."
5,Cute wolf_2678,"CapCut is my #1 fav app! It is the best app and a great experience! All the transitions are very cool and the stickers are amazing! You can even extract an audio FROM your video, which I like, and it’s a great app overall!  All though it is a great app, here are a few suggestions: For audio editing, I feel like you guys can make it even better by creating a little icon that lets you create 8D audio, which makes the audio echo in a smooth and a clear way. What you can also do is add “realistic” sound effects. When I say that, I mean like in audio edits, it has a little sound effect that makes noises such as an echo laughter, etc.(Sorry if that doesn’t make sense) :’)  For transitions, you can add a different icon that says “Transition Effects”. This icon can have things such as oscillate! And with that, I feel like CapCut can be an even greater app!  Now, one last suggestion:  For the text, maybe try and make text fonts that are much more unique.  Anyways, those are some of the suggestions I would like for your next update in the future. That is, of course if you get a new update."
5,ma123 abc,"Very amazing good for edits and got me many likes!!! One suggestion is that you should add 3d space, that could make it more like after effects and more like Funimate and overall just better edits so please consider that and also maybe more effects like the displace effect from tiktok and more filters like the ones fan pages use. Also maybe a community page that we can share our edits on and also templates instead of shortcuts and maybe people can create templates because that would be cool because then people can do it and it could be a trend. Overall a really good app and capable of a lot of things! Just please read this and maybe consider adding them to the app."
5,Cloud_Angel,"I use this to make gacha content everyday and it’s so easy to use. I was an original KineMaster user, and thought that it was the superior app. When my sister downloaded this app, I was extremely salty and refused to use CapCut and only thought of it poorly. KineMaster got an update and I was a little disappointed with the new KineMaster, I tried out this app, and wow! It is great. I apologize for roasting this app in a positive KineMaster review. That was like 6 months ago. I love this app and it was the best app choice I ever went with when it comes to actually editing. Please note that KineMaster is my #1 app, but I only really use KineMaster for tweening.  Thank you for (hopefully) reading this through!  Love ya, see ya, bye!"
5,KiraOceans,"This app is my go-to for editing. It’s straightforward to use, reliable for different types of videos, and overall just so engaging and fun. 100% worth checking out. Favorite editing app I’ve ever used, and I’m so appreciative that it’s free.   My only request is to please allow a ‘change for all’ option when it comes to text styles. Like when I change the spacing between words, I would love to have the option to do it for all the text in my video and to continue with this format for the next text, similar to what happens when I pick a font/size. If that option could be added, that would be AMAZING!   Thank you :)"
3,reagan de alba campbell,"Now I have to say myself, this app has helped me out a lot and I’ve mastered almost everything in this app. I have loved these new updates coming out! The only thing that’s making me concerned is that it always says that my storage is full. Now understand that my device is old, and that makes sense (but I only have 5 or 6 apps right now, and 3 of them I need to download again because I haven’t used them). So that should be about 2 or 3 apps only, I may have a lot of photos but my settings says apps are the most. So I’m thinking CapCut is taking up some of my storage, but of course I love this app and it does practically everything every other app does. I hope people see this because I would like to know if it’s just me or if it’s other people too! I LOVE THIS APP THOUGH!!"
5,hdjdigj,I like CapCut cause it has brought out the creative side of me and it is also and excuse to go on my phone while not playing video games. I like it because you can use it in everyday life. Now I would say I’m probably a 2 star editor but I know I can get better. But my friend and I were thinking how it would be really cool if CapCut had like almost a tik Tok on it so that you could post your edits in CapCut and not have to get other social media cause you no some kids that are good and like editing and want to share them can’t because they don’ have tik tik or instagram or Snapchat. Other then that I love CapCut but think about my proposition cause it could really boost the people who use you app.
5,Raymond Sinnott,"This app is very good to me, I just got it a few days ago and only used it once to make one video, and this turned out to be my favorite editing app. I recommend this app. There is so much stuff. Chroma key is one of my favorites, look it up if you don’t know how to use it. It’s very awesome! The one video, I made, I love it! Thanks to capcut, I can make awesome videos!  It might be hard to use, but trust me, you’ll get used to it, I got used to it very fast. There is so much buttons, yeah, it could be confusing, but that’s because there is so much editing tools! Again, I HIGHLY recommend this app.  This is just my side, but I hope you guys make awesome photos/videos, thanks for reading this review!"
5,gimmeyoapplesauce,"I really love CapCut. I've been using it for three years its easy to use and has many things you can use for editing, but I would really love it if you were to add an advance mode (which is free) where the user can use 3D text and video. I aslo recommend more 'Party' effects. And more opitions for 'Mask'. For example, you can have a 'Mask the person' button which cuts the main thing in the video or picture all by itself. I know theres a low possibility of you seeing this, but if you do I would definitely use the app even more than I do. I also recommend getting more 'Basic' effects and 'Animations' for transitions. Thank you, an bye."
4,Levi why,"I’ve been using this for months and I’ve almost mastered this app, I love it. This app has features that other apps make you pay for. There’s no premium, it’s all free which is crazy because it feels like a premium version of an app. While this app is amazing there are a few things they should add. 1; the ability to merge text/overlays with the video, this would mean if you merged them effects would apply to them, same with adjustments and movements to the original video. 2; The ability to toggle motion blur on/off for text and overlays, which means when they move (with keyframes or animations) it has motion blur, and would be much smoother/professional looking. Otherwise this app is all I need, thanks!"
4,LowkeyyMaryy,"I’ve had this app for about a year now and I must say, this is BEYOND incredible. The presets are very useful, and effects are marvelous as well! The fact that you can remove the watermark FOR FREE is such an amazing feature; I never have to worry about missing out on anything because I can’t pay for it but instead all is free! I love the templates that they include as well! I feel as if it is so simple for me to get around and find out new things! You can completely animate anything with the presets and key frames (which comes very handy when feeling a little creative)! I don’t find myself changing apps anytime soon! In my opinion this is the best editing app for beginner editors and EVEN pro editors! This is definitely an underrated app."
5,Kejuan cooper,This is the best editing app and I’m so happy with how many effects there are for me to use on my YT videos this is definitely an all in one editor. I just wish that when I was adding effects that I could split the effect bars bc sometimes I want to put the same effect split up into multiple different parts very close together and I hate having to go all the way back in the effects and scroll through to pick it again. I just wish we could cut and extend effects. I hope someone who created this app sees this and make an update to allow this feature. People love ease of access and not stuff that is difficult. I love this app and it’s amazing that’s its free 9.5/10
4,jayla zayas,"Now I have no hate against this app because it’s very simply and easy to use. Even though we have presets, you can also make your own transitions you just kinda have to think about what you want to do. The effects on this app make the clips look 10x better! Even though I really like this app there is one thing I feel like it’s missing. GRAPHS!!! I just feel like it’ll make transitions much more smoother. I love the fact that we have presets but also that has a downside. We can’t control the smoothness of it. The duration thing doesn’t help either because it only handles how fast it goes. Please make an update with graphs! I’m sure it’ll attract more people to the app especially with the no watermark thing."
5,Ten4Zen,"This app is so cool. Works great for making fan edits! There’s no watermark and it’s all free, which I absolutely love. The transitions are super smooth and very cool, however, I have some suggestions! The first being that there could be smoother transitions, like some similar to After Effects? After Effects isn’t a mobile app which is really a bummer, so it would be beyond amazing if you could make something similar for mobile. The second suggestion is more fonts to use for videos, but I do love the ones already listed! The last suggestion is more cinematic transitions, effects and filters! But other than that this app is great and I will continue to use it! Thank you!"
5,ffutyv,"I love cap-cut. This app is my life and soul, literally. I love all the cute effects and filters available for all. What i love is that there is no premium and no one had to “pay” to get the ”premium” life. The only thing is when you aren't on the app for so long you have to download it but you can’t because of where you are placed. Cap-cut has so many cool features that i am still figuring out. I have helped a business woman get customers using this app. The only other problem is that you don’t understand what to do unless your introduced to all the equipment.  It took me about 1 year to finally make some decent videos. I hope you like this review and pick this one. CAPCUT IS AWESOME SAUCE!!!"
5,Wildmigee,"So, I was looking to make edits, correct? I came across other apps like Kinemaster and(I don’t remember the name) to use. But they were both extremely difficult. So, I saw a Gachatuber using this, and I was needing anything at that time. So, I downloaded it and starting fiddling around. I got the hang of it and made things I am very proud of! But, due to lack of storage I had to delete many projects. This also helped me out with a school video project once! Anyway, I am here to thank you for making such a simple app. Also no- I am not a bot they used to write a good review, I honestly did enjoy this app.   Edit: I have more storage now so hopefully I don’t have this issue."
5,"(37:):8/!,8?'a","This app is amazing! Anything that is a bad review, they probably just don’t know how to use the app. Now I do have some few suggestions first of all maybe whenever you’re trying to cut something it’s kind of hard to click on what you can do you know, so I was thinking you could like have a little button in there for like the video part. Also I would like some milk more filters I have seen some that I really like but they get taken off more filters please! Oh and for beginners maybe like a introduction video if you choose to help you figure stuff out. But otherwise this is a great game and I don’t know why he doesn’t have a five star review."
3,Bella Victoria Martin,"I really liked this app. It was so fun, easy to learn, and was easy to make videos on! I have used this app ever since December of 2020, and I still use it. Although, there’s problems on here that need to be fixed. When I tried loading up the sound effects, it said: “No internet connection, please try again.” And I checked my WiFi and it was perfectly fine. Another thing, when I exported one of my videos, it didn’t go the way it wanted. It made my video very laggy, and the quality was horrible. Could you fix this issue please? If you do, thank you. And, after a while, I had to delete this app because it was taking so much of my storage. I’m sorry if I can’t play this app anymore. I loved this app and I can’t play it because it took so much of my storage."
4,Lovable Lilah,"I love this app! There are lots of effects to use and sounds and you can even add some audios from videos. However, I kinda wish they had more effects like Video Star and Funimate. And it takes up a lot of my storage. Even if I delete all of my projects, it’s still full. It’s great and all, but some things should be worked on. There are a lot of glitches when I add effects they don’t work. It doesn’t happen most of the time.  I also kinda wish the CapCut ending video at the end of each video wouldn’t be added by itself all the time. I usually forget to delete it and I post videos on TikTok so I have to take it down and repost it. I mean, I love this app! It’s great! Just some things should be worked on."
3,tomhollandsfuturewife;),"So this app is awesome!! I got it like 3-4 weeks ago and I love it!! Everything is free and the effects and animations are amazing 🤩 but starting yesterday I was making an edit and basically half of the animations wouldn’t work because they claimed I had no internet, which wasn’t true because my Instagram and all my other things that require wifi were working. I tried re starting my phone, logging in and out of wifi, etc nothing worked! I just deleted the app and now basically none of the effects or ANYTHING is loading😐 PLS FIX THIS I RLLY LIKE THE APP!!! I already sent feedback. Honestly I need this fixed bc I have an editing account with a big follower base and I can’t just stop uploading  UPDATE: After several days of it being deleted I redownloaded and it still didn’t work😐FIX THIS PLS"
5,Mya_104888,"Capcut is so fun to use. It’s not to hard and I get things done quickly when I use it. Don’t forget that it’s literally FREE!! I don’t know any other editing app that’s actually free, you always have to pay using other apps. Like video star, I use it only the free things though. I’m not trying to disrespect video star it’s just that not everyone can pay to use the things on there, it’s completely fine though. All I’m trying to say is Capcut is free and it’s easy to use! Even if I had all the money in the world, I will always use Capcut. I really hope Capcut doesn’t put prices on anything also, why should they? Their app is doing great! I love it."
1,Donttouchmenow,"Hello there creators, hear me out. I’ve been using capcut for almost a year now and I definitely would recommend it to someone that are novice to editing. I know that u creators are working really hard on capcut to give us the best and let us experience a great time with capcut. The reason why I’m giving this a 1 star is because of a glitch or bug when changing the speed “normal section”. Whenever I try to change the speed using the “circle” it doesn’t let me. Whenever I drag the circle to a certain speed, it just gives me a different and totally random speed. This is really really annoying, at first I thought maybe I should delete the app and reinstall but I did multiple times and it’s still the same. Please, fix this bug. I use an IPad 8th generation.  I would give this a 5 star as soon as it’s fixed. Otherwise, I’m moving to another editing app. Thank,  Ryan."
3,izz.500,"Cap is a very good editing app from beginners, CapCut was the first editing app I used (I started using it in June of 2021), it’s very easy to use and locate the things on the app. I just got the new update and the added graphs!!! Honestly the key frames are pretty annoying but they work. The motion blur is more of a direction blurry but they do have a transition called then and now which is sort of motion blur. The slomo is awful and there is no good shake… the text is fine, but I wish you could use a loop animation and a in and out one at the same time. A lot of the issues would be small fixes/changes to the app but would make a HUGE difference. Over all the app is very good for a free app with NO watermark. I actually LOVE this app I would just love to see changes in the future to make it better."
4,lilshrimplet,"I really like this app because I love making anime edits. However there are some problems with exporting. In some cases when I export it will show a black flash (very short) that isn’t in the edit when I hit play. Only when I export. I even ran it through a new project, cut out the black flash, and when I exported it, the flash was STILL THERE. Another thing that slightly irritates me is how you can’t see some overlays. The app is dark, which makes it very difficult to see black overlays. (Maybe you could add a light mode.) I also have new effect ideas. Maybe add tiles (like in alight motion) and have keyframes (or animations) for effects. Other than that I really love CapCut and will always use it! :)"
5,Lily <3 😝,"This is a really great editing app, and really easy to use for beginners. I watch tutorials for CapCut and can understand them very easily. The only thing is that it take up lots of storage and its wont let me edit anything, even if its just for fun and I’m not uploading it or anything. If this is possible, I would like adding a photo into a video easily, as an example, I used to use clothing star. The function “PiP” in the app allows me to add a picture in a picture in a video if that makes sense. Like, 2 photos in one scene? Of course, if that is to much stress, thats fine! I would definitely recommend it to others!"
4,unikitty gamer🐱🐱🦄🦄,"Every single time I delete all of my projects (because I’ve already posted them) it’s still takes up 2 GIGS of my storage! I need this space for other things like Tiktok so that I could post these projects. But even when I do post and get rid of these projects the app still says it takes up 2 GIGS. When I click on it to see if it’s just the app size, it says it’s the “documents and data” that I have stored on CapCut. NOTHING IS ON IT!!! so HOW is CapCut taking up all of this room!?!?!? Overall CapCut is good but this one problem really bugs me. CapCut is a great editing app and SUPER easy to use, and maybe I’m just being dramatic but if you could please help me with this problem."
5,The0ne333,"Love everything about this app. I do a lot of shooting and editing on my phone and this app has been AMAZING. A lot of the other apps you have to pay or upgrade to get certain features but with CapCut you get everything free. The only small thing I’ve noticed is that when I export the finished product the audio and video are a little out of sync. Just by milliseconds or a second but I’m able to fix it by using another app to detach the audio and line it up. Still playing around with some of the other features but would be great if there were some tutorials on tricks and other cool features like masking, etc."
5,idk......... 😕,"So, this is a great app for beginning editors like myself. My favorite part about this app is that everything is free!!! Unlike other editing apps you don’t have to create an account, pay for pro features, or watch ridiculous ads. Just add it to your hearts content! One thing I do recommend is that you let us film videos with background music. I also think that a lot of people don’t use iTunes so maybe you could let people use other music software‘s/apps so we won’t have to screen record things to extract the music. I’m gonna wrap up this review, but I definitely recommend this app and hope you get it as well!"
3,Puppyapyap,"The first time I downloaded this, I was amazed! It was super useful, and the effects are SUPER fun to use! But when I log back on today, and try to download another effect, it said I have internet connects. I thought that it’s a simple fix, so I disconnected then reconnected from my internet. But it still didn’t work- I tried to look up what the problem was but I found nothing. Now despite my unfinished projects in CapCut, I deleted the app, then redownloaded it thinking something would happen. But the same issue occurred once again.  Please help! Is there anyway to fix this?? It would be such a let down if I couldn’t download any effects in this app... and it’s also not just the effects, I tried adding text, but I couldn’t even change the font!"
4,VanillaLJ :),"This is a really great app! I use it for lots of my edits and it’s really easy to use especially sense it’s free but there’s one reason why I can’t rate it 5 stars. Thats of the lag. I edit on my iPad all the time and it gets really frustrating with the app freezes or can’t keep up with an edit I’m doing. I get really annoyed and just want to shut off the app while I’m in the middle of a edit. I don’t really have this problem when I use the app on my phone but it’s always my iPad (Which I prefer to edit on) I’ve tried re downloading it and deleting some of the videos in the app but nothing really works. So if you could fix this bug that would be wonderful! Other than that, great app! 😁"
3,𝒬𝓊ℯℯ𝓃𝒷ℯℯ,so I realize whenever you get to a certain amount of storage in as a very very time consuming editor I like to make sure that it’s very good to make sure it’s on the exact same points and I like to have all those overlays. But the only thing I would fix about it is well there’s two things him I would let us use more than one font when we’re texting like just let us use two or three maybe. The next one I would like to say is when we have storage filled up I don’t feel like we should have to go clear everything and make sure that everything‘s fine honestly it made me mad every time we had to do that so those are the things that I think just need some work to fix and yeah Have a wonderful night everyone
4,randomizer on the Internet,When I started using this app it was really good since I have a fan page on both Charli D’Amelio and Maddie but it could use more the graphics are really low and I need to quality higher whenever I post it on TickTock or any of my other social media‘s it just like the quality it just becomes really static he looks like a really bad Wi-Fi and graphics it just needs more features honestly I’m being honest maybe animation more animations for the text and the auto caption doesn’t work I’ve tried it multiple times maybe update that other than that it’s a pretty good app and it’s really easy to learn on my video star am I like it personally you don’t have to like it but I think it’s really good
4,kybrns,"Y'all need to add an option to merge two clips together please, it would make my life so much easier. Whenever I make a split that's just slightly off it would be easier to just merge the two split clips together again and then make a completely new split but because there's no merge option I have to make a bunch of splits that are unnecessary and make editing very confusing. Not to mention, if I wanted an animation to last a specific amount of time, I couldn't do that since the animation only lasts as long as the clip is, and the multiple clips from splitting so much make it impossible to get the length I want. Everything else is perfect tho xoxo (but that's a really big issue tbh)"
5,gen Z person,"I love this app so much all the features are really good and it’s completely free. You don’t have to pay for extra stuff like taking a watermark off etc. But what really bugs me is that there’s no way to make an account. I recently had to change my phone and I’m not able to get that data back from all my edits which makes me really sad. Maybe there’s something I’m missing I don’t know but that’s how it is for me. Right now I’m not even able to re download it for some reason. I’m tryin but it’s not letting me but that may be something with my phone. Other than this I really recommend the app, best editing app ever."
5,adqie_,"this app is amazing !! ive been using it for a few years now and all of my edits are made on it. it’s super easy, pretty fast, and comes out with some pretty sick edits !! i love it and i rlly recommend it for beginner editors. this app has helped me a lot and has given me a lot of references for certain things. it’s easy to use and to understand; from what i can remember, it only took me a few days to pick up on the controls and the stuff in it. if i have to say anything “negative” it is that there’s no smooth slowmo so, i recommend using VSCO or Timecut. i use timecut. velocities are easy to make, transitions are pretty easy, and overall, it’s a rlly good app. 10/10"
4,Eevee 2017,"…questionable, to say the least.   I’ve had nothing but great experiences with this app and the new update (dated ~4/23) won’t change that. However, when editing videos, there will be audio lag that normally isn’t present. For example, when editing a video, I will listen to it before I export it, just to make sure I don’t have to go back later. However, when I listen to it, it sounds perfect; when I export the video, the audio is very clearly off by a good half-a-second, maybe even more.  Other than that, this is my go-to editing app! It’s great and I always use it for almost all of my needs. (However, the template button for iOS devices would be good too!)"
4,potato pal 2819394,"I’ve been using CapCut for a while now for edits, and I’ve found that it is super easy and useful. Until recently. Lately I’ve been having the problem of when I click on a video to upload into CapCut, it takes a really long time to load, and when I click done after cropping the clip, it takes FOREVER to load up and import into the video. I know that it isn’t my WiFi because it has never been like this until now. Now, I may just be being impatient but I used to take half a second to import into the app, and I wish that it would be like that again!! Please help me or fix it. Other than that though it has been wonderful and perfect for my edits!!"
2,Techspert04,"Hey there. I am Techspert from Instagram Guys I just wanna say that idk it's just for me or is it for everyone that capcut after it's new update is acting very very weird. 1) brightness slider is very very strong now, I can't even increase it to 1, because it's just becomes way too bright even at 1 level 2) Same as vignette slider, it's very strong now. Not working properly. 3) Whenever I am exporting any video then I can see pixel blocks in my video around many areas. .. So guys overall the experience is completely changed after it's new update. I reinstalled my app today due to some storage issues and when I tried to edit my reel it's just not helping. I grew my account from ground to 70k only because of capcut. I use capcut for all my reels but I don't know if I can use it anymore.  If you guys ever see my msg so please try to bring back old adjustments back to capcut, I am trying to edit a reel from 3hrs but it just isn't helping at all. Also I am using an iPhone 13 pro so I m definitely sure that it isn't my Device issue. So please if you see this msg kindly check what's happening to capcut app coz I really can't use any other apps. All other apps are kinda weird. I hope this problem resolves soon."
5,theappmademeratethis,"first off, this app is GREAT! i use it for loads of my edits and once you get the hang of it you can make loads of great stuff, but there’s always things i wish the app would have…  for example:  being able to lower the opacity of effects, and slow them down a lot of times i want to use effects like the flash effect but i kind of just want to lower it if that makes sense 😅 and slowing them down kind of speaks for itself, sometimes a lot of effects go by really fast and it would be better to slow it down to fit the edits  i only have two suggestions that come to mind right now but those would be really useful!"
5,bella mia bell,"I have worked with multiple editing apps. This is on my top 3 list. It’s great for beginners and I easily adapted onto it! I’m a Roblox + Gacha tuber and this app has been with me half of the time the other was kinemaster. But we’re talking about CapCut right now. It’s great for beginners, easy to use, rarely laggy ( only twice within a couple months ) , and best of all there’s so many effects to choose from!   Editing apps usually eat up my Ipads storage but this one lets you delete your projects/videos. And that definitely helps me! My storage can’t handle much (32GB) and this app doesn’t make it harder to manage my storage!!  Something that annoys me is that when I’m making an edit and i need to spin an overlay, after time it lags and makes it go crazy on its own. I feel like this app should be able to handle something that’s just spinning around perfectly fine. If that would be fixed this would be a perfect 5 star review.   Please fix my issue! Thanks for taking your time to read this, and goodbye!😘⚡️  -Unkown⚡️"
3,🐺🦋🕷XxSpiderWolfxX🕷🦋🐺,"So this app works sometimes at least for me but I have tried a bunch of things. I’ve tried refreshing the page, turning off my device, closing my tabs, clicking off the project I’m making and then try again but over and over again this app has glitches when I’m trying to make videos. The weird thing is it will skip clips that I put in and just goes over it. The sounds that I import will get cut off and it’s super weird. Overal I would give this app a 2-3 out of 5 because the things you can do are pretty cool but this app glitches a lot for me. I still think you should try it out if you really want but I personally want to try a different app to make videos because this one doesn’t work very well for me. ☹️😬"
4,Ellie_idk_lol,"I love this app, I think it’s the best editing app that I have tried so far, but there are some problems that I have. So first I’m going to tell you about all the good things, there many effects, you can make cool animations, add what ever sound you want, not that many to no adds at all, and even more. But the bad things, it used to let me change the opacity on the text and background of the text that stuff but I can’t anymore, I don’t know if it a glitch or people just can’t do that anymore but if it’s not a glitch I would really like that back, and  I really can’t think of anything else other than other tiny glitches. I love this editing app, and think it’s amazing."
4,cattykit345,"this app is literally everything an editor could want.  it’s free, that transitions are amazing and already made. i use this app for roblox and normal edits and it’s great with doing velocity!! just a few suggestions to make the app even better  -the option to put more than one transition on a clip! like wobble and bounce 1 or pan right and distort right. i do this already by exporting the video and just adding more to it on a new project, but it would be LOADS more productive if it was an option already!! also, maybe the ability to create transitions or shakes of your own!!  -more effects!! some examples of cool effects would be stuff like motion blur, shakes, stuff like that would be amazing!!"
4,Supacalafragalisic,"i love this app and highly recommend it to anyone starting out editing, but something happened earlier. i was going to make a edit on capcut, and it told me that i had insufficient storage. so i went and deleted a bunch of things so i could make the edit (i had 1+ GB of storage after deleting). I went back to capcut, and it still said i had insufficient storage. So i deleted the app to redownload it, thinking it might fix. But i ended up not being able to download the app again, and it just has a swirly loading thing instead of actually downloading. My IOS is up to date snd i have storage available, yet it will not download. Please fix this issue. Thanks."
1,jensbsbsbsbsbd,"I personally don’t like this app because it doesn’t let me download fonts and it would be better if it had graphs. When I try and import the font it doesn’t even show I my files and if it does then it shows up grey and doesn’t let me tap on it, literally going to get anger issues from that I was literally I personally don’t like this app because it doesn’t let me download fonts and it would be better if it had graphs. When I try and import the font it doesn’t even show I my files and if it does then it shows up grey and doesn’t let me tap on it. I was literally punching my phone LOL. Also you Guys should add motion blur like the one on vs where it’s called “vs motion blur” and where it could be able to change the settings it would be SO MUCH BETTER instead of paying for it. And you guys should also add coloring like vs it would also be 100x better. And that’s all bye :p"
5,n1ckw3b3r @insta,"I had the iPhone X but it broke so I didn’t have it for a while after that. I ended up getting the screen fixed and then the iPhone ended up being bricked so it had been about a month and a half maybe more and I finally got an iPhone 8 an old one so I downloaded this app to realize the animations have changed there’s now three selectable styles in,out and I believe combo. I can’t find the apply to all button like I had before. I don’t know if this is my fault or a very poor update. So far everything else is good. (Edit) it was my fault, I was doing animations when I meant to do transitions. Changed rating from 4 star to 5 star."
5,Ciara 🤍,"I honestly think capcut is really easy and for People who say it’s not and it’s not an editing app your honestly just using it wrong the amount of things you can do on there is good. However I wouldn’t compare this to any other editing app. Other apps have more options and variety of options when editing, not saying capcut doesn’t but they’re software is different such as vs and ae you can’t compare those depending on the app or software itself. They’re all amazing apps and softwares for editing but due to how good you are will obviously change your perspective. So if you know how to edit on capcut you would honestly realize how easy it is ."
3,felipe dog🐕‍🦺,"So I’m minding my business about to use it when it tells me I need photo access but it was weird because I already had access, I didn’t mind it so I went back to give it access when it didn’t give me the option. I was super confused so I deleted the app but the next thing heartbroke me when it told me again it needed access to my photos and the option again wasn’t there. All my edits were gone and then I tried it with a different editing app and it worked, I’m really confused and sad. I can’t tell if it’s my tablet or it’s the app, I’ve tried many times but the only options it gave me was Siri and notifications. If you can, please respond to this review or try and fix it. And if it is my tablet also let me know. Bye^^"
5,IosUser1018,"Most problems I experience with free video editing apps consist of 30 second time limit, big logo, etc. stuff you have to pay for to get rid of. But this one is great, no logo, no obvious limit (I only make 3 min long videos max though, so can’t say for certain), a lot of good effects, basic tools like splitting, deleting, trimming, moving. Another problem I had with a different app (24fps) was that it would lag when I would try to play the video and it would pass from one clip to the next, but this one is super smooth and has no glitches. Love it! Also has great animation effects, def recommend overall."
4,⭐️MerMer⭐️,"I’ve only been using CapCut for a few weeks and absolutely adore it! Editing is super easy and the layout is very easily understandable. However it feels that almost every time I open the app I’m hit with “insignificant storage” even after deleting multiple apps, hundreds of photos and videos, and clearing cache from as many apps as possible. I never faced storage issues until this app. If you have insignificant storage your also not allowed to even view your drafts until you clean up. This is incredibly frustrating. Other than that issue, the app is incredible! and people really seem to enjoy my edits that I put so much work into, all thanks to this app."
4,Minorin_rose,First of all I am still very confused on why the removed it in the first place it was very helpful and saved a lot of time but now I have to use more of my time just to one thing. Also they would put it back and take it off again like if ur trying to get us mad it’s working bc A lot of people are now more confused. Like please say if ur going to keep it or not bc I’m not wasting my time on a app that can’t help me with normal things but overall it’s still a good app it provides access to different filters that make a video look good yet I’m to tired to try and make a velocity edit when u guys have it to us and took it off but that’s really it
4,FonziZeFeistyPet,"Capcut is an overall good editing app but I do have a few issues with it. 1: The overlay feature broke. I was making my video which was around 3 minutes long so I spent a lot of time on it, but when I exported it, I noticed all the overlays somehow shifted on their own like 10 seconds ahead, and I couldn’t even edit them cuz they didnt show on the overlay editing tab. 2: Text always overlays the effects. I want my effect to also affect the text, but when I add an effect and then text to my video, it just overlaps the effect which is kinda boring. Overall it is a good editing app but please fix these bugs and issues I have with it ok? Thanks!"
3,itz_leah <3,"So before this all started happening CapCut was the best app I’ve ever owned but I tried exporting one of my videos, it said your camera storage is full please go check that out and come back so I deleted a few my videos and photos and,I tried to export my video again and it said the same thing,so I literally deleted all of my photos I only had 15 photos left and four videos,so barely anything in my photo storage so I tried to export the clip again, because I needed that video and it didn’t let me it said the same thing so I’m literally don’t know why you’re doing this,I literally only have 15 photos I don’t wanna delete all those because those are literally very old memories of me and my family so please if you fix thank you!"
5,edits.maddielol,This app is amazing I’ve been using this app for two years now and it has so much stuff to do. Especially to make Roblox edits i’m pretty sure a lot of people use ROBLOX and edit from this app and it’s amazing! But today I was going to make a Roblox edit and I found an update that has been gone! It was of the Velocity thing it was in the style catory!⚡️ and I know it’s gone i’m making this review because I just want to let Cap cut know i’m really hoping for the update back that update was amazing and I was hoping a whole lot of people who is trying to make edits out there.😅but keep being awsome with your app!!💕
5,Amber3444,"This app is fun and amazing for edits. Although i don’t recommend tweeting gacha life on it cuz there is a small max of layers, it’s still nice to use. There are so many effects and animations and you don’t even need to pay! There is also no huge watermark unlike KineMaster and cute cut. There are so many options the text, animations, effect, filters and more! Once i saw the ad for it i thought it was a big scam but then i saw people were using it on tiktok and i was convinced it was good. After i got the app i noticed that it was super easy to get used to in 1 day i knew where everything was from animations to effects. So over all i do recommend CapCut for you."
2,Ashe Shurka,I had to use CapCut for editing when I began and then I moved up before coming back to CapCut to see what other options they added. Honestly it’s not much. The reverse is so slow and the whole app make my device slower. The effects and animations barely where updated and there was few newer ones. I’m disappointed and unsatisfied. I sat at my I-phone screen for about ten minutes and the reverse percent was stuck at 95% so I exited and tried again and waited about ten more minutes and that time it was stuck on 52%. It’s quite irritating and annoying. Not to mention the speed option. When you change the speed it’s not smooth at all! It’s choppy and sloppy. I did not like the results and I will most likely be going back to my other editing programs.
4,kaursthatcode,"Capcut is a perfect app to edit and make awesome things! Some great youtubers, tiktokers, and others use it for edits or videos about things like roblox, gacha, or anime. But, it’s not all perfect. First of, I think there should be more voices to say text. Not all people like 2 types of male and female tones, and not all can be used. I was also hoping it could take up less storage, since on my device, it’s always low storage so I can never even use the app. I usually need it, but end up in disappointment due to the storage problem. Lastly, I don’t have the option for the templates? I’ve been really wanting to make a trend but could not due to this problem. I hope you can update the app!"
4,kadeisvoid,"This app is actually pretty good considering what it is, and I’ve made a lot of stuff I’m proud of on CapCut. But there are some problems, of course. Like the fact I can’t click on one of my videos because I’m out of storage, I just want to watch it. A way you could fix it is possibly letting the user click on the video just disabling access to adding things. Yes it would still be annoying, just less. (For me, at least) there’s also a few other problems but they’ve been stated quite a bit in the reviews already, so I won’t list them off right now. Other than those problems, it’s a great app. It works really well."
4,The weirdo?,"Honesty this app is amazing it has amazing beginner stuff, but I feel like it could be better. Don’t get me wrong I love this app it’s just, I think some more filters would be nice! Like…some of the filters funamate has like what I’m saying is the overlays and the shapes! Also idk if it’s just me but LITERALLY EVERY Roblox character glitches. And u CANT find any green screen ones! Like when I’m trying to make an edit they ALWAYS mess up. Anyway, the lag. Just the lag. It’s horrible idk if it’s my phone but I doubt it. I’ve deleted so many edits just to make new ones. I really hope someone sees this because I feel like some of this stuff REALLY does need to be updated. Anyway have a good day!"
5,reviewer 353747,"I love this app, it is working out for me. I would never think to find an app where everything is free and works wonderful! There is like cool transitions, it’s really easy and organized compared to other apps. And it is just cool, try it out dudes.    But I have a suggestion, I would love that pictures that are gifs are able to keep motion. You know what I mean? Like gifs are able to stay gifs, that would be amazing because the only other method I find that makes that happen right now is making the gifs a video which consists of me video taping my screen and that is a long process which takes my album space."
4,✨Aves✨,"I absolutely love Capcut. there really aren't any limits when it comes to editing, because everything can be done, really.  Its also quite easy to use for beginners! The edits usually come out looking professionally done, which is also nice. And its all free. Which is super helpful to a young editor like me. However I have ran into a newer glitch, to where every time I go into full-screen to review an edit, then try to leave it, it literally crashes my whole phone. Like, my phone freezes and then powers itself off for about a minute. This has really gotten on my nerves considering the fact that its the only app that does it. But other than that, Capcut's awesome."
5,gacha life Tuber,So when I got this app I would make trash edits and didn’t really like the app because people would say this app is trash but it’s REALLY AMAZING 🤩🤩🤩 it’s such a easy app to edit and understand and I like how it makes you an edit by itself and everything is free!💗 I like this app for tiktok edits also😄and maybe can you make more updates? Also I like the new effects you added whoever made this app is a queen👑/king👑 and the music is also free and not much adds! 👍 none should hate this app 😊 but if wanna tween I suggest to use their apps. I tried tweeting in capcut but it wouldn’t let me add more layers!😭 but that’s the only problem 😢 great app🤑
5,ELI3388,"Hi CapCut, I really do love your app but I do want to make a few suggestions. I had made a few edits and videos using the app but then someone deleted the app and my videos were deleted because I didn’t get to save them to my camera roll. So if you can, could you maybe make an update where if you delete the app you can save your projects? It’s like a backup for CapCut for when people delete the app and get it again their projects will be saved. I think that this suggestion would be really helpful and useful to other users using this app. Thank you for reading this!"
3,Ashlyn.sudol,"as someone who has tried various mobile editing apps, I can say CapCut is one of the best. However, in order to make it better, there are some things that need to be changed. First, the storage issue. I’ve deleted tons of photos, apps, restarted my phone, etc. and still...I am unable to create a project due to issues with storage space. It doesn’t make sense. I’ll be making an edit and leave the app, come back, and then I cannot continue due to this storage bug! Second, after rendering my video, clips and audio are out of sync by a millisecond, it’s a small issue, but pretty big when I depend on hitting certain beats in an audio. Third, I love the app, but I cannot continue to use it with the storage issues. Thank You."
3,britneymichelle,"i’ve been using this app for almost 3 months now without any problems and it’s definitely my favorite editing app that i’ve come across. However, about a week ago it stopped letting me extract sound from my videos? it just says “cannot extract” or something like that. i’ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and restarting my phone and other stuff but nothing seems to work. Every video i’ve tried to extract the sound from hasn’t worked. This is just frustrating because sound is like the base for my edits and i cant really edit without sound so i haven’t been able to use the app at all. I still gave 3 stars just because this is the first time i’ve ever had a problem and i really love the app."
4,Mad hayyer,So capcut is a really good app I’d recommend it but there’s a problem with the keyframes and I’m not comparing but a lot of good editing apps have graphs and It’s really hard to use keyframes and make it look smooth without graphs again I’m not comparing this app to the others this ones amazing too! But it would also be a lot more interesting if you add transitions onto keyframes because someone like me usually adds the audio then overlays for the photos and video but I can’t do that here it would also be cool if you could adjust the speed for a transition like a graph would for keyframes? If that makes sense. But I’m very pleased with the app it’s just hard to work with!
4,catkitty1326252,"I feel like you should DEFINITELY add more songs and be able to search up the song you want. I’ve been looking for one song for so long that’s IS in there, I’ve used it before, I just can’t find it again. Please look at this and consider doing it! I think this is a good kid friendly video maker app. I would definitely suggest it, I hope 🤞🏼 this review gets noticed and y’all update the app. My friend is making her way to famous.(maybe in 8 years). She has more then 100 subs already, And she started like a 3 months ago! This app is amazing for videos and photos! I love making my Gacha club edits into vids with this app! So to bring it all down, this app is great!🥰🥰🥰"
5,this_app.,"CapCut is an awesome app. I use it all the time to make funny videos. Nothing is wrong with it, and it seems that so much more can be added too to make the app even BETTER! I have used CapCut for so many things, especially when I’m on a road trip, but sometimes when I take a picture when I’m on vacation, I see something I don’t like and I want to get rid of it, but I can’t. So I just have to keep retaking the picture or video until I get it just right. So my suggestion is maybe add an eraser, so you can erase things you don’t want in the video. Anyways, CapCut is spectacular! I would definitely recommend! Thanks!"
3,Dajdjjsjajsjdjsa,"Overall this is a cool app but when it comes to glitches this would be the top 1 editing app. One of the reasons are when you guys make edits on the app TikTok but when you edit it I feel like you guys ignore the glitches that are worldwide, for example: when an overlay has a mind of itself? (Key frames commonly). I would be GLAD if you guys fixed that, but also I recommend you make a velocity graph so people don’t have to do so much work to do that. I know you guys probably see that on TikTok, this is why people don’t necessarily call this app an edit app when you guys probably want to be referred as one.  Once again, OVERALL THIS IS A COOL APP   P.S you may need to check your coding because they may need an update."
4,Gamer Only,"So to start off I just wanna say I love this app, it’s so easy to use and just super awesome and I don’t have to pay to unlock some extra features but it’s missing one thing, folders. So I like making gaming clips it’s what I do and it’s just relaxing for me but I also make other stuff too on this app but there’s no way to organize all of my edits, like stuff that I made a month ago will be all the way at the bottom and so I have to scroll pass a bunch of my edits just to find the one edit that I made and it’s just annoying so that’s why it gets a 4 star. But once they add in a folder feature I’ll immediately give this app a 5 star."
4,Somebody ;-;-;-;-;-,"This app is really good for making simple edits and is perfect if you are a beginner. It has loads of presets, effects, transitions, etc. and the best part is that it’s completely free! But there are some issues.  1) sometimes its very laggy, which is normal for any app but its hard to see if the transitions and animations are smooth.  2) basically all presets, I've been using CapCut for a while because its easy to understand once you get the hang of things but you can’t really customize the transitions and animations 3) no motion blur option, I find that apps like video star are extremely confusing and kind of expensive so when I found CapCut I was happy to find a free editing app but there is only motion blur and other blurs on the presets which means i can not add it to transitions i make with keyframes  4) no graph, graphs make transitions with keyframes a lot more smooth but there is no graphs for the keyframes  There are some more things but I think that this is still a great app and really simple to use I would definitely recommend getting this app for editing"
5,🥴Its👏me👏Liana🥴,"I was in need for a good editing app. I’ve tried many others and none were as good as this. Capcut is all you’ve ever wanted and more! It is a great editing app and you can do so much with it. I use capcut to edit all my school videos and they turn out sick. It allows you to add music and adjust the volume of it, it allows you to add cool effects in the beginning and throughout your video. It also provides you will cute and cool stickers to include in your video. It is not complicated to use but some of the buttons are unclear, you’ll get used to it though. I recomend this app no hesitation. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, GET CAPCUT!!!!😃😃😃✌️🤯🤗🤠💗"
4,Dragon City player/ fan,"I’ve been using this app for a while now, and I must say it’s truly amazing. I’m a really beginner editor and this simple app helps a lot. Even though it’s ‘simple’, it also has tons of features and if you use it right it’s a pro editor.  I’m having great fun with it, and every time I edit I learn something new and apply it. Anyways, I have a few suggestions: 1 - You should add the ‘mark effect’ to text! 2 - For the ‘mark effect’, you should make it so that you can draw your own portion of what to cut out so it’s more accurate 3 - PLEASE add the ability to add effects to the background without it being on the normal video/image. For example, I add a video, adjust it, and make a blur background of the video. I would LOVE to add effects to the background. PLEASEE add this! It’s probably what I want most out of these!  If you’ve already added these, I’m sorry to bother! I didn’t realize there was an update and I’m actually updating it right now. Thank you so much for the amazing app, and keep up the good work. Have a great rest of your day/night."
5,matbrottog,"After having a long video edit deleted by imovie, in rage, I felt like giving this app a shot. And without a SHADOW OF DOUBT, this is 100x better than imovie! Not only is it actually EASY to use, it contains a 100x more features than ANY OTHER editing app I have seen. Yes, other apps do have more features, but NONE OF THEM HAVE THEM FREE like capcut! I have not seen one add since I started, haven’t spend a dime, and was able to create a video 100x better than when I had it in imovie! It even looks like video made from expensive editing apps! Download this app and ser it for yourself! And yes, I am a real person and this is a real review! Thank you Capcut❤️"
3,LaysieDaisy,"I’ve had CapCut to make my edits for about a year now, with the splice part of overlay I learned how to make it glow and all but I have 1 problem, and it’s a big one. Capcut freezes in one spot if if it’s multiple overlays and key frames with those overlays it’s really annoying because I can’t see what my project looks like when the main parts of it are frozen? Although it does show up unfrozen when you export it, I want to see my project before I export it. (I’ve tried adjusting the frames to 60 and 20 that didn’t work and I tried reducing the quality again didn’t work) please fix this! It’s become annoying to edit when you only see a frozen screen and then it cuts back to the rest."
5,axolotl thing,"so.. during my experience with this I’ve had little to no issues. the options are straightforward, and honestly I’d recommend this to a beginner. it doesn’t have a watermark, it has tons of free content, and it’s all-around enjoyable. the only complaint I have is when it comes to overlays. i wish we had the ability to have more overlay layers, which would make it easier to do tweening and things like that. I’ve been using this program for a good five months or so, and I wouldn’t go with anything else for basic videos and such. hope this review helped anyone looking to get this app."
4,🍄shrooom🍄,"Would like to preface this by saying I love the app, but I think it could use a few things. Firstly, I would like it if you could add blending modes for the overlay function. That would be much easier than adding effects to my screenshots in ibis paint and then putting them in. Simple ones like add, multiply, screen, overlay, pin light, linear light, etc. I would also like to be able to muffle audios, as that could help me with what I make. Also, maybe being able to add multiple animation effects on the same screenshot? Mainly just the blending mode thing, I’m rlly begging for that one.   Thanks to whoever made the app, I love your work, please consider my requests."
4,winterbearaestheticc,"I’ve been using CapCut forever now, and there is one problem that gets me very concerned and ANNOYED AS HECK: the storage issue. I’ve deleted ( like fully deleted.. like deleted them once they got moved to deleted pics) all of my photos, edits, and vids once, and IT STILL SAID I DIDNT HAVE ENOUGH STORAGE. ;-; I’ve become very aware of this and have deleted and re got the editing app to see if it worked or not, and it have never worked. I’m just hoping if there is any way you guys can fix this, I would rlly appreciate that. I would appreciate if there were more options in effects ( like more borders  ). I love this app, even more than Vita, but it’s just gotten a bit annoying! 😬"
5,Hunger144,"Using this app was amazing. For editing on a phone they really made everything pretty seamless with great quality and a wide range on tools.  However, I needed to make some space on my phone and deleted the app to do so. Now that I am trying to re-download it keeps trying to download ""kingdom wars"" instead.  I get a message ""you already own this app so no additional charge"" then ""download kingdom wars on wifi or cellular""? And the App itself never appears on my device.   So it appears I can never use it again.  Even if I let the game download, I come back and have no way of downloading the app itself."
5,Cheese duck,I love CapCut a lot more than most editing apps because 1: no watermark! (Unless u don’t wanna remove it) 2: lots of good filters and other features. All in all it’s great (my storage isn’t the best right now and CapCut takes away a lot of it maybe you can do something to reduce storage take away? Also please add more overlays this is my fav editing app and I usually don’t add a lot of overlays to my videos but when I do it’s a pain to do all the work and then not be able to add them! Then I have to use mine aster which has a watermark and the editing it’s a bit harder since I learned on CapCut. Thank u for your time!!
4,user927481,"As a user of capcut for a while now I have come to see the pros and cons of this app. The transitions and animations are amazing as well as the options for text like animations. But the one thing I don’t like about capcut is the phone storage it takes up. Even though I clearly have enough space on my phone it still says I need to clear up more. My only Solutions are either deleting and reinstalling the app or restarting my phone. I hope this issue can be resolved in the future because this is really a great app. If this does get resolved in the future I would give it five stars.  Thanks for reading my review,       A fellow downloader"
4,CJ 😤😤😤,This app is amazing. It gave me anything and everything I needed to edit my videos. Except for one minor bug. I wasn't allowed to edit in some categories like filters or some video effects. I looked up the solution and it turns out I need a VPN in order to fix it and I don’t really want to pay for it. That was a couple months ago and my oh my the issue has gotten way worse. It has gotten so worse that I can’t even edit transitions. And half of my edits I can’t even access as well. I don’t know if it’s a bug or if I’m doing something wrong. But please someone confirm or deny. Thank you for reading all of this.
5,❤️CapCut User❤️,"My rating on CapCut is very high. I use this app for literally everything! I love to use it to edit my tiktoks, or fun videos I make. The only thing I struggle a little bit with is the music. I have to use a voiceover just to get the music or sound I want!! Overall this app is super easy to use, and even right when I got it I already was growing so fast on learning how to edit. This app has helped me grow in editing in ways I never thought I could. The only thing I suggest is maybe adding some songs to add to your videos, or make it able to where we can put an id or something for the song we want! ❤️"
4,elezhau,"I use this to make my edits, and when I put a Audio in, it’s fine at first and then I download it. But then it makes my edit low quality and blurry. And when I go back to look at the edit, it turns out that the audio messed up after I downloaded it. I shorten it down a little bit and the whole edit messes up! Also, maybe allow where you able to paste a link and then it puts in the audio for you? That’s all it needs.  Edit : somehow while editing I pasted my audio in and after a muted my other clip, the audio just stopped working and I couldn’t here anything. CapCut, please fix this 😟"
5,goodluckycharm,"Hi! I’ve been using capcut for about 2 months and it’s the best app ever! Everything is free, the templates are AMAZING! And, best of all it has audio velocity. + You can get rid of watermark which is just amazing. Some downgrades though 😭 wish I didn’t have to say this but my velocity disappeared for 2 days… it was super annoying I close the page a bunch and it didn’t work. So I deleted the app and that didn’t work either :( then the next day it was ok it came back. Slowly but surely I wish their were more effects and animations. Now looking back people put bad reviews just because they don’t search up how to do it HAHAHAHA🤣 but I honestly think you deserve to be the first.   ~Graphs~ Graphs are amazing! They need more work. When I use graphs I usually zoom out but idk 🤷‍♀️ if that’s how ur supposed to do that lol please give instructions yt tutorials are complicated and I can’t figure it out 🥲 Overall 5 stars!   |Sxmplymac|"
4,JarellAncheta0116,"Lately, whenever I use the split tool for adding new clips or adding animations in them, towards the end of the clip, it shows a frozen frame of the previous clip at the very last second before moving on to the other one. It looks weird and very tightly cropped, and whenever I remove just only one millisecond of the previous clip, the frozen frame still shows up for like a split second. I don’t know if I could be the only one experiencing this, and it is kind of difficult to explain, but I did my best to explain the problem I’m having. Maybe it’s just me, though! But still a great app, nonetheless. 👍"
5,✨Nuggets✨,"I love this app when I had vita I wanted to be An editor but something with vita was just like wrong until I got CapCut I started to edit more and my edits started to get better, easier and faster :] but I definitely suggest this app it’s amazing it’s free and it has everything u need to edit u can customize ur text add sparkles add some cool/cute stickers and some effects also what’s cool is that to make the pics and videos look cool u can just click the pic/vid press animation and find a animation right that fits this app is not a scam! U can also green screen with it and everything I can’t say enough to say how cool this app is!"
5,LynxBeOnIt,"This app is absolutely phenomenal the transitions, the way you can speed and slow down things, the sound effects and the extracted audios is my favorite I absolutely adore this app please continue to make improvements on it. This app is flawlessly the best and cheapest way to edit your videos. Plus all of its free. Great app please continue to add more transition that’s my favorite because it actually looks stunningly designed with a dribble and drop and the blur effects. It’s all fantastically put together. Astonishing app keep it up and for the people reading this I encourage you to give it a try it’s absolutely amazing!"
5,amiplayz,I’m telling u if u are making any sort of edit this is the best free app out there I’ve use all of them free and this is BY FAR the best one.  Although it does take a while if you want specific things like your text animated or putting text on a video this app is 100% free and pretty much the same( if not better) of the apps out there that you have to pay.  Don’t pay attention to the bad reviews this app is totally worth it.  Even if you don’t like it then u can just uninstall it :D.  Hope u found this helpful!!  (Also If you want to see how good this app edits then check out Survivorplayz on YT)!
4,HorizensGirl,"So I switched to this app when my old one started lagging, and it was 100% worth it. This app is just like my old one except, 1. there are no constant advertisements to make the app a better experience, 2. There is no water maker, and 3. You use chroma key to add some background. The only thing that this app was missing is some form of pivot points, this is essential for tweening anything, because this is not in the app you have to eyeball the rotations and hope for the best, other then that... I highly recommend this to anyone who want a easy and free way to animate with rigs on your iPad and/or iPhone.😁"
3,i'lljustleavethishere,"While I love this app and its many features, it lacks an important one: merging layers. I used capcut for a documentary project and  added 5 different audios to a picture (all the audios were put as overlay). Of course when I needed to add a video before the picture, the audios overlapped on the video. It had a simple fix, really. Just merge the audios on the picture so when you manually move the picture, the audios are basically attached to it so they move too. However, this did not happen. So I could not put the video before the picture unless I manually moved up all the clips that came after the picture. That’s too much work considering I had 30+ small clips. Please add a merge feature."
5,Issy_karrots,"I’ve had CapCut for almost a year now and I’ve got to say it’s one of the best editing apps out there, in my opinion. I’m just now writing a review because lately the app has been glitching and it’s never been like this before. When I try and export a video I look at the results and half of it is frozen- I have no idea why it’s doing that but I’m getting super frustrated with it. People keep telling me to I download the app the download it again but then all my edits I’ve ever done on that will be gone. So this goes mainly out to the CEO of CapCut please fix this soon! I really want to make more videos on your app!"
1,oh my God it's an angry Latino,"My friends and a ton of people i follow that make edits use this app and when i got it i was at a friends house down the street and was starting my first edit, i was able to put all of the photos i needed in and time them right but when i went to add filters and animations it said there was no internet connection when i had full bars and full wifi, so i thought it was my phone being weird at my friends house and i would try at home. I got home and tried to keep working on the edit but again it didn’t let me access anything saying there was no connection, i tried multiple times to disconnect and reconnect my wifi but nothing works and because apple updated and won’t let you delete and redownload something my last hope is gonna and i cant finish my edit."
4,Anon8259,"One of them is when I add a video after the original video(s) I added, it tends to glitch, showing a weird green pattern over the screen. I can even reset the app, delete and re add the clip, or re download it, but it still happens. At one point I had to update my phone for 10-15 minutes in order to stop it from glitching. Also, a lot of times for the first split second of the clip, it will show a different part of the video that he part I cut out, so I have to split the clip in order to make it go away. Otherwise the app is great, if there was a pc version that would be even better."
5,KING_YUAN,"I’ve been on the search for a free video editor when I thought a found one. I’m not going to say the app out of respect but when I finished editing a WHOLE video, it said I had to pay to export it. After some time how ever I found CapCut. Long story short it had really good features like seamless transitions, chromakey and more! One thing I would like to see happen is more optimization for iPad like adding the tools more accessible and maybe if possible make the interface kind of like Final Cut Pro and more mechanical noises like pistons.  Other wise best free app. Would give a 4.8 so I’m rounding it to 5"
4,bcuioplanfs,"Well, I been using this app since last year and I loved it! It’s amazing but there’s a problem about that I would like to explain so what I want to talk about is that i am very disappointed on why I can’t do velocity thing for me and my updates for Capcut are very slow so I do accept more of you for many reasons but I do believe that this app could be for good used for socials and more! And I am not going to say this is a terrible app! No no no no no!! This is a amazing app to edit things on the internet and immediately impressed people that you like and reply how you can improve on you own videos! And I love this for me! 💗💋💋 BYE!"
3,Marvel Rat,"Dude CapCut is just being so just HAUSJZUQSZJ and like I’m tryna edit but like it stops the video for like .7 seconds and i cant edit it right cause its doing that and i even deleted some stuff so that it would work but no- it decides not to work and i really need to edit a video! But idk why its like this, also whenever i make an edit, its in sync right? But when i export it it is completely out of sync and is like 3 seconds off… i mean ya CapCut is an amazing app, but its been like this for almost a whole entire month and it’s starting to get oh so very annoying! I mean, like CapCut is still amazing thats why i give it those 3 stars, but since that has been happening i will take 2 stars off."
5,Cricket :>,I used to do a lot of editing and it’s perfect for people who are looking for a simple app to improve their skills. It’s great for simple goofy things or some edits of a character or movie. There’s ton of effect and endless possibilities. I used to always be looking for a free editing app and I’m really grateful to have Stumbled across this one. There is tons of tutorials on how to do things and the effect can be very helpful. They are always coming out with viral effect that make your videos look professional or just brand new things that are still awesome!  This is a awesome app! Pleaseeee download it! Have a nice day :))
3,57xa,"I have been using this app for about 6 months now. It has been a great editing app and I used it for everything. But I have a problem. Every time I try to save a video to my phone it tells me that my storage is full on my phone. I have deleted tons of photos and a bunch of stuff and done all of the methods, even cleared the cache and almost all of my projects/drafts, but it still will not let me save a video. I even tried resetting my phone multiple times after the methods. This all started when I tried to save a 24 minute video and I shortened the video up to 8 minutes but it still will not let me save any of my projects. I really need help. Do you have any suggestions?"
5,🥽𝐴𝑠ℎ𝑙𝑒𝑦👻,"So I had really really fun times with this app I edited with it and did almost every edit with it so won day I updated my computer and iPad and then I forgot about this and when I remembered the whole thing was different I didn’t know how to do things so basically it kept getting worst until won day I did to effects and then I kept adding and it kept freezing and kicking me out I did another update and it was the same so please stop it from doing this other then that stuff it’s a great app and I will keep using it even tho I have to upload alotttttttttt Friday, November 13 🖤"
5,Emo boi or girl,CapCut is pretty much the best app because no watermark and you can have multiple layers but I had this app for like 2-3weeks and when I go and see my like anime edits it says “install now” and don’t get me wrong! But it dose this to all of my edits even my old edits and it kinda got annoying cuz it did every 0ne of my edits. But I might be just me that experienced this because I kinda have a lot of photos- and I’m not saying that this is a bad app it’s just the only thing annoying me but out of that problem this is the best app I ever downloaded or installed!.😁   Oh and this happens like now in August or in September~
4,Kakes817,"I love using CapCut but still find it annoying at times. When I make edits, it usually lags and don’t get to see what it looks like while editing. Usually when I export it, it looks fine but I don’t want to make an hour long video for it to look bad. I don’t mean for this to come off as hate because with isnt, but it definitely could make me happy for it to not lag!   Now, if you think I’m being to greedy with the app, I probably am! You can’t make a game to stop lagging, it’s going to lag no matter what. It might’ve my phone, or the app itself. Idk so if it is the game, please help, if not, sorry for wasting your time :)"
5,watermeloncookoopants,"I’m going to be honest, I LOVE THIS APP!! I use it all the time when I’m editing but I think this might just be me. Whenever I cut one of the slides down to be smaller ( shorten the duration of the photo) it’ll always glitch and skip past some of the photos, it’s extremely annoying and hard to work with. Also some of the pictures won’t show and it’ll just stay on the first picture you inserted. Like I said this might just be me but it’s annoying and makes it hard to edit. If you can fix this I’d be very happy, thanks!"
4,skfirehawk,"Well I do use CapCut to edit mostly all of my edits, but I really wish there was a option to change the pitch and not just slow down the music we imported or picked from the app. It would be extremely helpful if there was a option to change the pitch because then we could adjust how low the sound can get or how high. Even though you guys have a option to slow down the music which kinda makes the pitch deep it makes the sound super long and hard to edit. I really like the app and I will most definitely keep using it but if there was a pitch option it would be really really helpful. Thank you."
4,Briantheman23,"Overall everything works pretty alright and you can do some decent short video editing, lots of settings to mess with and change but not overwhelming. Lost a star due to the lack of communication with users. For the reader’s reference: The auto velocity button was removed with no explanation and I had to find out that they were working on it through a comment Capcut made on tiktok. I shouldn't really have to say this but if there is a major bug, alert the users. Also potentially add custom zoom animations and maybe some more 3d styles.                                        If you read this far here you go 👉👑"
5,kndksksnshdhdjd,I love it! My favorite thing is that they don’t have any watermarks! But I would like that you would save my songs when I am done using them and can you like make it like a video when your done with the video? Because it takes a bit too much space on my iPad/ iPhone I love it because you don’t need internet to use it! Effects are amazing! Can you add a bit more things? I would like new features like you can do a mirror like double videos next to each other and like you can notify me for new features to keep up? I love this editing app! Easy and free! I love it so much! <3
5,Azalea Pollock,"This is a great app and all, but I want to be able to add music from my files. I'm trying to make an intro for yt, and I was finding some songs to use for my intro. I recorded some songs, and put them in my file, and when I got on this app, I added a picture, to see how this app actually works, and some options. (I just got this app.) and I clicked the add music button, and I didn't see an option to add music from my file, and I got sad.. so, can you please add a feature to be able to add music from a file? Thanks if you do so! Right now, I'll just use iMovie to add the music."
5,sydeny cool,(I’m only giving 5 starts because it’s a good app but I’m just experiencing an issue)  Issue ⬇️ So basically out of now where I wanted to make a edit but I couldn’t use effects for some reason and it said that there was no Internet connection so I was checking my Internet I was connected to Internet I have LTE I tried restarting my phone still does the same thing said I had no Internet then I even deleted the app and download it again and it still said the exact thing please let me know if there is anything I can do.
5,Glaxywonders,I used CapCut it was really easy to use  and it was just a few things were hard for me and I got really on my nerves but it was really good I was kinda not good at it then I go I said before  my phone may or may not been thrown across the room but yeah I made a really good your edits on it proud of them very proud of them but I did use shortcut I did not know about it but this was probably a stupid review but anyway I just wanna say that cupcake was amazing and I really hope y’all download it and enjoy how you make your edits I won’t talk anymore have a good rest of your day or night
4,ndndhshsbsh,"I’ve had slit of editing apps and a lot of them needed you to spend a lot of money so I gave up. Then I found this app im still working on getting better with editing but there are so many options and cool effects that you can use. Would very much recommend this app to use while there are still some other professional editing apps this one is perfect for me and slot of my kids use this to make edits and post videos. I love how there aren’t really any ads, you can just edit without being interrupted while there may be a few it isn’t over loaded with ads unlike some games."
4,kol mikaelson ♡︎,Hi I’m writing this to show my appreciation towards this app. Editing has quickly become one of my fav things to do and CapCut makes it easy. I love how I can do so much for free and how great everything about it is. However I do have a slight complaint. I notice that anytime I copy a clip and make it an overlay and add graphs the clip glitches and I am unable to do anything however if I remove the graphs the clip is fine. This hasn’t been an issue until recently so I’m hoping it’s just some bug you guys could fix. But it is really bothering me. That’s just what I wanted to share. All in all though I love this app I use it everyday. Thank you so much
5,Yupeeee,Ok so like I said its amazing overall but it would be easier if you had put in like one photo if you could divide it into equal new photos:Explanation is if I had a screenshot of my gacha character that i wanted more screenshots of but I didn't want to put the same pic OVER AND OVER AGAIN I could click the divide button and press a button of how many screenshots I wanted and bam there you have it! If this is not possible the whole reason I requested this is so you can have more than one animation in one photo thing/video. Otherwise great app 5 stars!
4,Sarcastic_Candy998,"I love capcut omg! i recommend it to all my friends. its a good app and there is a bunch of cool effects and features at your fingertips! not to mention it is super easy to navigate, unlike most other apps. however, it has been extremely laggy lately? i got capcut around a year ago, obviously there were less features, but there was also less lag. personally, i like to make edits of me and my friends. im also a youtuber, and the lag makes videos 2 minutes or longer hard to edit. overall, capcut is amazing, and i still recommend it to everyone, but i would love it so much more if it was less laggy. <3"
5,Cosmic Kiddo,"i love capcut! i’m a pro capcut editor so i know how to get around some stiff transitions. but i’ve been kinda tired of wasting my own storage, and a while ago graphs were added to capcut (by far my favorite update!), and now one more thing is missing to make the app more like video star and alight motion: tiles/mirroring, turbulence, velocity, skews, and really just all the things that video star and alight motion have (even funimate!). i’d do anything to get those and make a transition with them and graphs. so i’m begging you capcut, in your future updates, add them! capcut’s format is way easier to learn and use than any other editing app. i bet me and a ton of other people would be able to learn how to use all the things i just listed way faster on capcut than any other app. you could even make it cost money to get those! i’d pay for it! other than that, capcut is an awesome app for beginners and even pro editors!"
4,Bannana milkshake,"I started using this app a day ago, and I found it really easy! I really like the effects, and the transitions. I’m also glad you don’t have to pay for these effects, and other things. But when you edit the pictures, and go to combo. It gives you a certain amount of duration until it just stops moving. When it stops moving it’s around 0.6-0.7 duration, until it stops just on the picture. I find that...kinda annoying to be honest. And it would be very kind of you to fix that! I’m not that good at explaining things, but I hope you can understand! Definitely recommend it tho!!"
5,Violetsaint,"I was scrolling through Tik tok too see some beautiful edits, and I came across a wholesome Anime edit. I really wanted to know the program the creator used to make the edit, and I saw the comments were like— “This person is using capcut lololol”, but i didn’t let that get in my way. Honestly, i thought to myself, “This app must be really high rated and pretty neat”. So, A while later I downloaded it- And honestly, I have no self doubts about this app, this is just honestly beautiful. The transitions, effects, everything. If I’d have the ability to rate this to a 100, I would, because honestly- I love it! ❤️"
5,hdbshfnrjq,"I absolutely LOVE the app it has to be one of the best editing apps! It has so many options and even has stickers that are a trend around the world! The animations (my favorite part about the app) are what make the app so special. Just one thing.. when I use the text bar for the lyrical edits there's not so many animation options, I'd like the text animation to be as good as the animations for the clips! If you would be able to do that the videos would be extra beautiful!! But overall, I would rate this 5 stars because it is as I stated above, one of the best editing apps! 😊"
4,LilStinky07,"I was working on a basketball edit last night and didn’t finish. I was planning on finishing today, but whenever I click on the video, it says, “Couldn’t update. Try again later.” It says to check network settings and my Wi-Fi is full. Then it says, “If you failed after multiple attempts, save project and wait for version update. However, the update was today. I can’t watch or edit any of my videos. It really pisses me off, too. This app would be a 5-star. Usually this problem is quick to solve. I just refresh the app and it works. But it doesn’t work now."
5,Addie ;-;,"Overall, it’s a very good editing app. It’s a very good app for beginners. But today, I was editing a video and I was looking for the “Style” button. I and was so confused about where it was. I was gonna make an edit with one of the things in the style option. So then I thought, “Oh it’s probably a glitch. I will just delete my tabs.” But, when I did the style option wasn’t there. So then I was looking through TikTok and etc. and I found out it was removed. My only problem/request is, bring the style option back!"
4,AnotherFlipflop,"I’ve been using CapCut for over a year now and I love it! I make edits constantly with it; it’s easy to use and user friendly. Although there are some cons to it. For example: I can’t combine a loop effects with “in” and “out” transitions. In my opinion, they should be two separate things that can be combined. There’s some more problems I have with it, but they’re not too important, and personally it’s just things that I somehow figure out at some point 😂 Other than that though, this app is utterly amazing and I love it! I recommend it for most of my friends that look into editing, and most of them typically like it!"
5,Tabibri,"I’ve used A LOT of different editing apps, Filmora, KineMaster, IMovie, VideoStar, AlightMotion, but not get near CapCut. First, when FREE there is no watermark. Second it has multiple layers, again FOR FREE, which is rare now. It’s free in filters and transitions make it look like your a professional video editor.   My only request, which is more of a suggestion than a complaint, is that we should be able to search for transitions and filters and animations because sometimes it gets tedious scrolling through all the options.   Otherwise, amazing app, and you should download!"
5,hankorama47,"So this app is amazing for my edits and I use it all the time but there is something I would like to address. First of all, the animations and transitions and a little corny so it makes my edit look like Vinkle which is not a good thing. And lastly, when you drag the cursor so that you can go to one place of the video to the other, there is no sound. I would like sound because if there is a beat in the video, I need to get it perfectly so it looks good when the video splits. Anyways, the app is amazing but I would really like for these problems fixed. Thanks!"
5,MagicalTangerine,"If your looking for a really good and free (without ads) editing app, this is for you! Everything is super easy to use and everything is 100% free. You can make edits or just photoshop pictures. There are so many things you can do on this app. My favorite part is the video editing. I can add more videos, delete old one and even add my own songs. I personally use it to do character edits with different tools like the effect tool which really helps if you can a super cool but easy look to go for. I love this app so much more than video star or splice! It works like magic!"
5,aryzonaa,Ok I honestly never leave reviews on anything because I’m just lazy but i had too for this! It’s honestly the best editing app I’ve truly used paying for and being free. You get so many features and it’s so easy too work with once you get the hang of it!! You find out all these little features throughout the way and it’s just overall awesome! It does kick you off randomly sometimes but it’s not like often and it’s when like too much is happening which is understandable as other apps do that as well! But overall just an awesome app and would def recommend :))
3,SecretHighAddict,"Now, I like making gacha videos for fun. Lately, I’ve been looking for and editing app that’s simple to use, and I don’t have to pay to remove a watermark. CapCut covered both of these! It has the simplicity of cute cut, but with more features and no watermark! Ideal editing app, right? Yeah, for only one freaking day. I literally got this app YESTERDAY, and it worked perfectly for the first couple hours. I was very happy, because I thought I found my permanent editing app. Now, It constantly freezes, and so I can’t get anything done! Even when I restart the project, it. Still. Freezes. From opening the app to actually making the video, it just freezes and “lags” SO much....."
1,Fiona fox 102,"capcut worked good for me for so long but then I recently got issues. So my wifi is fine, I have storage, and my sisters cap cut works fine we got our new iPads the same day. Whenever I open it everything says no internet connection it never did that before even if reinstall the app or delete sm stuff it still does that. Please fix this. Also my phone doesn’t have this issues. My bff is having issues too. When she opened it, it was just a black screen now that she reopened it sm it finally stopped, but her volume isn’t working, her camera roll shows the audio but you can’t hear it and the button to click audio on or off is on plus the volume was 100. She reset her device sm and reinstalled plus reopened it and still no. Fix your apps glitches pls."
5,Kawaii_l0seR,"I’m  shook. Just- this app is amazing, nothing bad; just beautiful. Like it’s easy to use, glad you Can use TikTok audios, and no lag- like the transition affects are also just ✨mwah✨ It’s easy to use and it’s amazing. It just seems so professional and it’s so good!! The animation is beautiful, so underrated and it’s just SOOO SMOOTH!!!  It’s not hard, it’s easy, and just overall so good. Like the motion blur is just ✨yes✨ And it’s beautiful, you have key frames, animation, THE GRAPHS TOO!!! ART!! I ALSO LOVE HOW YOU CAN REMOVE THE WATERMARK AT THE END    that’s all but my point is this is definitely a recommended app 💕 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
5,Samsara room=amazing,"I would definitely recommend this app to any mobile editors who want to take it to the next level while still maintaining simple and easy use.   This app allows you to do some pretty crazy stuff, there are so many different filters and many other editing tools, and my favorite is the 3d effect where it will literally separate you (or the object you are recording) from the background and add a 3d motion... absolutely awesome!  Again, how do you consider yourself a mobile editor if you dont have this app??"
5,Justamemerboi,"I have easy things about it it’s great and easy, but i need to let you know about these things So could you please add a ghost pop out effect where your characters ghost pops out not like a ghost but a pop out a effect so we don’t have to crop the same video and make it like a pop out effect Next can you make black flashing and moving camera shaking (not shaking and stuff I mean like a moving camera around. And like slow motion Effect where at one part of the video you can choose it to where you can make it slow down or reverse."
4,SimplyLee0414,So I LOVE this app. It helps me make anime edits I like or for friends. I make Gacha mini movies here. I also do some for holidays or to remind someone there special. But it won’t let me import a lot of pictures lately not even 8! So I’m concerned if there is a bug or something I checked on safari it said I may have too much storage I deleted some storage but it won’t work! Is or bc I have an iPad? NO! Before on my IPAD it would let me put sooooo much pictures what’s up with that. Well whatever. But yes this app is great. So I do recommend it for all you editors especially pros. So you should download it all of you amazing editors.
3,2019 is gone😭,"This app is overall pretty good. Better then KineMaster even. But the two problems I have with it are, there’s no zoom in feature like KineMaster has. Second of all. I’m trying to make a gacha video but every time I try to add text it kicks me out. And when I try to review my progress it stays on the last screenshot I put. it’s getting ridiculous because I have a time limit and Need to get this video out today. Please fix this so others don’t have to go insane trying to make a simple minute long video with text  edit: now that I updated it it’s the entire video now that’s every time I log into the video it kicks me out the entire app"
5,Jaxden000,"I love this app mainly because it’s free. Also, it’s almost like VideoStar and Funimate, but it takes a little bit more time. When you use this app for like a few months, you’ll get better and your edits will look better! Also, they have some good effects and always adds new animation for videos, and sometimes when I show someone the edit I did, nobody knows that it was CapCut and assumed I was using VideoStar! But, CapCut is like a starter editor, but very good too. I think you should use CapCut, then VideoStar, and then After Effects for editing. Overall, very good app!"
4,vivi<333,"okay so i love capcut and have been able to do some amazing things with it. but there’s just one thing i would love, and then it would be perfect. could you guys please add smooth slomos? they look really choppy and bad currently, and i have to use other apps to add the slomos. it’s fine, but it would just be so much easier if capcut itself had them. also, it would be super helpful if you could add a option where you can add multiple transitions in one clip. example, maybe you can put up to 3/5 on each clip. that would be so cool. but overall, i love capcut a lot and it’s helped me. thank you!   -Vivi"
5,MayMay💗💗,I love CapCut you can do so many awesome and creative things but all the Roblox YouTuber are talking about the amazing update but for 3 days I tried deleting CapCut and getting it back .And I also updated it but there is still no difference to CapCut.I really wanted to try masking and the new effects but I only have one new effect that is is the colorful frame one which keeps on despairing . I really don’t know why this was happening or how long I have to wait for CapCut to give me the update but either way it’s a great editing app with the update or without it.
5,Alex alexander alvarado,i have a quick question can you please make a new update were all my videos and photos i make on this app does not Erase when i transfer all my data to another phone. because my old phone had this app and when i transfer it to my brand new phone i lost all my edits/videos and photos that i made on this app so yeah it will be cool if you made a quick small update where you can transfer all my videos photos and edits so i don't lose all my progress of remaking that again. thank you for reading as well have a nice day
5,gacha_cool_one,"This is is the best editing app ever!! When I made my first ever edit, it was so easy! There was transitions, effects, and other things! Other apps like InShot don’t do any well. But there are A lot of trends in the internet, and some of them, you have to use other apps for them. MORE APPS-Maybe you guys can create a new app, for example capcut-roblox editor, capcut- Gacha editor. EFFECTS,other things- So, we basically have some trouble when we are editing, for example, you could add velocity’s, flashing videos, and more. Hope this message helps you improve stuff!!!"
4,Kitten and dog lover,"Ok I am in love with this app! It the best editing app I’ve ever had! CapCut has a lot of effects,audios,transitions,and its for free! This is an amazing app! But something happened today that I’m really mad about. Like most people I do Gacha and I use the Gacha screenshots on CapCut. Since I don’t want my whole photo gallery filled with those images I hide them as. On CapCut it would let me still use hidden photos and I was SOOO happy about that! But today it won’t let me use any hidden photos and it’s not even an option anymore! So now I can’t make my edit and I was really sad about that. I was going to make a special edit but now I can’t :/"
5,jdhang sixuebs,I have been using this app for about a year now I have learned a lot of things using it and have seen my editing skills improve if you need something easy to use I recommend this also this is perfect for beginners and pros you can really make some great things. Now for things I hope to see if you could add a community section we’re people can show off there creations and share tutorials that would be great I would love to rate this a 100/5 but it won’t let :) big props to the workers of CapCut and to the people KEEP EDITING YOU CAN GET REALLY GOOD
5,rainbowfan ponies,"I am currently using Cap cut to edit yt videos and so is my friend! It works amazing!! There is no watermark, and you dont have to pay for anything! I have had a great experience with it so far, I would recommend it to anyone who is not looking to pay for anything but still be able to edit good videos without a watermark. There is a bit of a problem with the volume adjusting though. You might have to adjust the volume a lot if you want to make the volume change a little bit. But otherwise great app and I would totally recommend.😄"
5,xx Lola xx,"This app, is a LIFESAVER. I was trying to learn how to make simple edits of pictures and videos, adding animations in the beginning and such to make it look cool. I tried multiple apps such as Video Star and Alight Motion. They were both VERY confusing and overwhelming and I couldn’t figure out how to use them. CapCut is very well laid out and easy to use. The controls are a good size and I can figure out how to add animations SO easily. I opened the app and in under 5 minutes I already have a awesome video. There is NO watermark and that’s so awesome. This app is AMAZING!!!!! 😝  -A very satisfied 11 year old."
5,tiktokfamous272,"Recently I was editing with this app, and I've come across a really bad glitch! Whenever you use Graphs, it resets chroma key and it glitches the animation to another part of the screen (for me it glitched only to the left of the screen). It ruined lots of my edits and really stressed me out. I have no clue if this is happening to anyone else, but I know that it is happening to me and it's really annoying. I would love it if you fixed this glitch and make your supporters proud! You've come a long way and I hope no glitch stops your journey."
5,EllieIpadUser,"I have needed a great app for a while that is not only a great way to upgrade and create videos but is also easy for beginners like me who may I have weak editing skills! CapCut makes it all like easy. Even though I may not be the best at editing videos, CapCut made my edits and videos look right out of a movie! I can’t recommend this app enough to people who are looking for something easy to work with! 5/5 for you! There is nothing I’d change! The only thing it could use is some add ons but it’s really amazing already! Thanks for reading this! -Fellow User"
5,utotpllp,"This app provides so many effects, length, and etc! I am so glad I found out what CapCut is because if I never found out what is was, I would be depressed!😅 here are so pros and cons of CapCut!  𝖯𝗋𝗈𝗌😎: - It has TONS of effects/frames to use. -It is easy to learn, barely confusing! -Has amazing quality when you export it!! -When you export the video, it doesn’t take as long, and the export thing updated amazingly! -When you import photos/videos, they can imported more then 100 times! (It’s just a saying I don’t know if it can😅)  𝖬𝗈𝗏𝗂𝗇𝗀 𝗈𝗇... 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝗌😞  𝖢𝗈𝗇𝗌😮: -It is very laggy when you add to much splits.

It’s is very useful and helpful. I just really hope you see this review and fix some of my problems! ✨☺️"
5,Kaelyn! <3,"Hey! I love this app and I use it for my roblox tiktoks because I’m on mobile. I have some suggestions for the next update. Maybe we could have some way to make sure videos and screen records stay the same quality throughout or some way to enhance quality without the beauty filter. Also, could we possibly be able to adjust the affects to our liking so that we can customize however me want? I feel as though I use the same presets all the time and can’t customize them to my liking. Please use my suggestions for a future update?"
5,catpop356,Even though it says you have to be a pro or something. I love that it doesn’t have watermark! And you don’t have to pay to remove it! And I love that you can remove the ending if you don’t want people to know it’s capcut! It’s great for making edits because you don’t need to pay to use cool stickers/effects or transitions (only a few you need to pay)! It’s such a fun app! And I also enjoy how you can screen record a sound and then place it into the upload video file and it’s just used as a sound! It’s a great app! And I definitely recommend!  -Upside Of Nat YT
5,ashleycz,Honestly we’re do I even start this is probably one of the best and incredible editing apps to exist when I first got this app I thought it was going to be like those other apps you have to pay for and use the lame transitions but no this was is FREE I’m very grateful that this app exist after using this free app for months I be came a master and doing edits everything is free comes with so many things LITERALLY!!! and I haven’t stoped using it I really recommend this app everything was fine when I got it I have no problems using the stuff they have on the app ITS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!🥰❤️
5,iwegjebe,"I have been using capcut for at least a year now, the way i can make extremely smooth velocities are amazing! But, The quality is a little off because when i crop the video/photo, The quality is mostly ruined and the sharpen doesn't help, I wish we would add tiles for the graphs because its kind of annoying having a black space behind the photos, Any motion blur on graphs or effects would be better so the edit doesn't look raw. Overall, I highly recommend this app for editing!"
5,Chloe Cortez,"I use CapCut for almost every video I make! It’s amazing, would recommend, but I have one suggestion. So you know when your adding photos in to make the video, I wish there would also be this feature where you can just slide your finger and it would select the pictures you want faster, like the app photos, when you want to select something on their you can just slide your finger. It would be cool to have that feature, I hope you think about considering about the suggestion!"
5,queenxoxi👑💜💚🖤,I love this editing app it’s better than a video star you don’t have to pay for anything and you can even get rid of the watermark but I have some suggestions for the animation we should be able to make our own kind a like a video star because it would be better to learn how to make your own transitions instead of using presets for the keyframes we should be able to click on the little diamond thing and we should make it like a transition type thing but other than that this is a good editing app
4,Glen/Candy,"CapCut is an amazing app, don’t get me wrong! Amazing effects, animations, etc! And this app is really SIMPLE and EASY to use! I was a beginner, I had trouble at first, but then I explored the app so much I mastered it! Really, it’s just smack down awesome.! But I do have some things I suggest. Now that I use this app daily to do Roblox edits, it keep on lagging! Like, I can’t even get through an app that lag a whole lot! So please fix that. And I would like for y’all to add more Text animations, because all the animations are quite boring! But that’s all the issues! And the lagging is getting on my last nerve so. But please fix that but yeah I do love it bye!"
3,My For You Page,"CapCut is a really good app to use for editing and I love using it, but I feel like CapCut should be able to make longer videos because I am currently working on a video that’s over 6 minutes long and it keeping kicking me out of the app even if in the middle of playing the video and editing it. I think the developer of the the app should prevent this from happening and should really try and get the app to not kick people out when they are in the middle of editing the video they are trying to make. This is just a request for some assistance on this issue but it would be great if they fixed the problem. 🙂🙂"
1,idk what happed,IT JUST GETS worse it’s like you guys are trying to fix it but giving it more glitches I’ll be trying to tween on it and it’ll make whatever I’m using go across the screen for no reason and it’ll just start flying around even when it’s not playing and I can’t even use that happen anymore because it’s so broken like what do I need to to to get it to not break every time I open the freaking app my friend goes into it it says that all her photos are private and that she cannot use them to the app because they were all private even though 15 times she made it we’re saying could use all her photos mine just breaks all the time I hate this stupid app to the dumb humans who ““ fix the bugs you’re just making them worse
4,adventurerin,"I’ve been looking for a video editing app for iPad Pro, as imovie was not cutting it. I LOVE the background removal tool, and that you can import GIFs with transparent backgrounds. That’s why I got this app in the first place! Great interface, simple and intuitive to use, takes advantage of the ipad (rather than feeling like a desktop app just plopped into ipad or downgraded for ios).   However…a couple functions would make things exponentially easier for building longer experimental video art. 1. being able to cut/copy + paste into another capcut project (and anywhere in the current project, as it’s basically just a duplication function rn—to be able to work on smaller clips and then move around  2. similarly, perhaps just being able to merge two projects  3. the ability to pin overlays and maintracks so that when you move things around / delete sections, the overlays stay put   Overall, love, and looking forward to updates!!"
5,checkthemic,I love CapCut it’s a great mobile editor and doesn’t take up as much storage as most editing apps do. I use cap cut for all my videos! It’s so easy to use and has everything a beginner or intermediate editor needs. I love how customizable it is too! From the text to the music you can have any vibe you want!    The only complaint I have is that you can’t do certain things without having WiFi like adding stickers and music. But otherwise this is an awesome app and I will probably use it for awhile. 👏👏👏👏 thank you for making capcut!
4,Zoë Tsuki,"When I first downloaded the app, it was really great and it still is, but as i got into editing with it and making more complicated videos, I realized that once you add text to a clip, you can’t get edit the clip without the text moving. This is useful sometimes, but it would be nice to have a switch to turn it off.  I spent a long time editing the text before making the video. When i was finished with the text, i realized that I wouldn’t be able to even make the video without starting over. Instead of 30 minutes, it took me and hour."
5,Hailey25x,"Recently i started to get into editing. Nothing big and fancy just cool little edits and stuff like that. I watched videos and tried several different apps but nothing like this. The fact that this app is free is awesome! There are so many features and like i said before its all free. This app allows you to even cut out the ending (its promo) unlike most apps. I definitely recommend this app to people like me who do little edits people who make tiktoks and maybe want some cool effects, for IG stories and all of the above. Give it a try."
5,Owentheanimator,"I believe that the heavens have brought us a god level app. for an app to be free, with removable watermarks *for free* and to have all of the features to make anime edits 10x faster and better *for free* It's no surprise that it's gonna have adds. If you want this app, take the adds like a champ, unless you have an add-blocker. This app saved me years because to make this level of edits, I would have to buy a computer, learn how to use the expensive editing softwares, and make my own effects. The level of impressiveness here just simply hurts it so amazing. oo/5 would pay money for"
5,~duckydayss~,"ITS AMAZING! Trust me, it’s very easy. There are great music INSIDE the app and easy to put in, so you don’t have to screen record and all that stuff. Your progress ACTUALLY SAVES and I’ve never had a time where it lost any progress at all. I literally just began editing and I’m already making better edits than experienced editors (with different edit apps). It’s 100% free and has NO WATERMARK!!! You may be thinking, “No way, that’s too good to be true” but it’s not. I promise you, when you download this wonderful app, you will NEVER have any regrets."
5,hyggiyuyouiuy,"CapCut is one of the best apps I used for editing, and it’s easy too!! But I have some ideas about it to maybe improve it! You should add this thing where you can post your edits so other people can see it, and like it! And also that you can see other people’s edits too! And don’t forget a thing where you can use the sound there using for the edit! Although CapCut is an amazing app! No adds, it lags on me but only when I do an edit that includes a lot of pictures! But it came out perfect! This app is definitely not a scam and is worth it!!"
4,melonelry3,"Recently after the update it refuses to let me use certain effects (specifically the bling ones) but all of the other ones will load. Basically what will happen is that it will say I ""don't have internet"", I literally reinstalled the app, lost everything, and its still saying this. At this point it has nothing to do with my internet for that reason. What does this mean? Is it a bug? Im really confused.  Hopefully it'll be fixed in the next update bc I was making a really good edit but once I went to add effects I got angry because of the fact nothing works no matter what you do..."
5,smsjsjsjj,So when I got CapCut it was working wonderfully for me but then every time now it lags and crashes so much and it’s not my WiFi because my WiFi is good hen I use other apps but then when I use CapCut it crashes and lags and it’s starting to annoy me may you check it out and when I do the insanity in the chroma key it does not work it keeps going to 0 never mind I made a mistake the chroma key is working and when I see how I edited without the full screen thing it won’t work I have to get out of CapCut and go back in
5,addie 1019,"I love this app it is so fun and easy to make all the edits! But a couple things, I’m a person who suffers from iPhone storage and CapCut takes up a lot of space!!!! Ivan never make edits because I don’t have enough I phone storage and I’ve tried everything I can!! I’ve deleted photos, apps, files, and downloads but nothing works! I’ll be making an edit and I’ll go eat lunch and when I go back on the app I can’t make it anymore! I’m not saying this app isn’t  great it’s AMAZING but those are somethings to consider if you suffer from iPhone storage like me"
5,🕶🤏,"Ok so capcut is the best editing app I have seen so far and trust me I have tried MANY apps! But I do have some suggestions to make it easier to use. The first one is searching, like you could search a sticker or and effect. The second one is I wish you could use it on computer. the third one is I wish that the text would move with the screen, like when I put an animation on and then the text it just looks weird. But besides all of that it is an amazing app and would totally recommend!"
3,Please cut down on the ads,"ok so, i would give it a 4/5 or maybe even a 5/5 but, the app is VERY. VERY. VERY, weird, it kicks me out of the app. I don’t lose any of my progress, It’s just VERY annoying. And also, sometime i can’t change how long i want the photo to be. No effects on it or anything and i can’t control the photo. Then i have to start all over again, and then i do lose all my progress. And even if i go back to the beginning of the edit to see how it is so far, it just is stuck with the photo that I had just edited. So all i see is that one photo and the audio, then i have to delete the edit and start over again. Please try and fix this. Thank you 🙂 <3"
4,BatMan420$,"This app is amazing, BUT minor details keep it from being the BEST. Make it where we can edit the effects plus some effects loop “make all effects a Continues flow” we might want it longer the 5 seconds plus I want to stack my effects and make certain effects dominate over other effects. “Layers” Maybe I want 2 or more effects at one time ect. We need more options when exporting. I definitely love this app and I definitely have a few other ideas that could make it flawless. But can’t remember right now. I will definitely use it more and update my review."
4,Electrical5721,"So I use this app to edit my videos on YT and I have some suggestions  For the first one can you add a search bar when you can’t find the thing that your looking for For the second one can you add 2 new screen affects like smear and circle smear(for circle smear the center isn’t smeared but the outside of it is) For the third can you please add text animations like the photo animations with the in, out, and combo so that it’s easier to make a text move with the photo That’s all I have for suggestions overall I really like this app😊👍"
5,Coniper,"I have NEVER found a video app that works so well and has. so many different components. Before CapCut, I had to use a bunch of different apps to get all the effects I wanted, and there was always some annoying problem I ran into in each app. (in addition to that, after being processed through multiple apps, the finished product was always very blurry) Now, with CapCut, it literally has every single thing I could ever want and it is so easy to understand and use that I could never ask for anything better."
3,BLFD1,"I know this is a good editing app! I see people edit with it all the time and the results are always amazing. I do have a slight problem (not sure if it’s just my phone) but I could have perfect wifi and it says I don’t have a connection. I don’t know if anyone else has this problem, but it just makes it difficult, because you can’t add effects, edit the text (fonts, style, etc.) I know it’s sort of a  my-phone problem, because I didn’t really see many of the reviews saying this, but just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else has this problem. Overall, it’s an amazing app!"
5,-just...Asia-,I love this app it’s really easy to use when I’m editing something or I just need to make a video and add the effects on another app but I recommend that that you fix the bug where when you put a picture and then you put your sound or song up there And the you try to pick another picture and it’s you have no pictures up that you have to exit out the app fully and then go back on it I recommend you fix that and the blue box on the stuff that’s all I have to say but rn I love this app!!
4,bcyhv,"It’s a great app for beginning editors but one thing is that I hope they could add a feature where you can upload videos in at least 1440p 30frames or 60frames because it compresses the video and therefore it comes out pixilated and not very pleasing, and how I hope they would develop 1440p upload is when you download the video to your camera roll the coding in the app would find that video on the internet and find the video that matches it and takes that 1440p video and matches with the one your moving to your camera roll"
4,Desta6,When I downloaded capcut (I still have it) I accepted the terms of service and the private policy and when I wanted to make a edit it tells me that I need to go to settings to accept to save my edits so I press it and I see no capcut on it only roblox and my other apps so I try to search it up and it’s still not there and I tried editing and It still didn’t work I even uninstalled capcut and reinstalled it back and refreshed the app and it still didn’t work so can you please fix this I think it only works on a IPhone but I’m using a iPad so again can you please fix it
4,katelynstars,So at first this app was rlly good and I was having fun with editing but then after a few weeks it started saying “insufficient storage. Clean up some phone storage and try again.” So it wasn’t a big deal at first and I deleted a few pictures an everything was good but then a few days go by and it happens again and i deleted a few pictures again and it kept saying that and even if it lets me in my edit I cant save it? And my storage isn’t even full it’s not even half way through which makes no sense and it has rlly been annoying me
5,emily rhinas,"ah yes, the most used editing app used in a LOT of places!! <3 capcut is so good and has creative transitions! theres effects, and all that stuff! you can also make custom transitions with a little help with effects! anyways, i have a little problem,... or just a question. when i try and create a project: it says i need to give access but when i go to settings i cant find the camera or album saving in the options. please respond asap because i’d just like to know and understand!"
4,wonderfuldream9456,"I’ve used this app in the past to make a lot of edits, but recently every time I make an edit, when I add a 5th or 6th clip it freezes for like 10 seconds and turns off the 30 seconds of the audio. and it’s not like it only happened once, I tried to make another one and it froze at the same time and place. idk if it’s a problem on only my side but I heard a lot of other ppl say it made their edits glitchy too. and it’s not even like this app is bad, it’s really easy to use in my opinion and I love using it but these glitches recently have started happening."
5,SchiXy 😈,"Really good for edits and it has lots of built in effects. My favorite effects come from the party tab and the retro tab because they fit my edit style. One day there should be an option to create your own transitions which would open a lot of creativity for users. The only problem that i have with the app is that when you lower the volume, it doesn’t lower much but cap cut is an amazing app that always gets better, they update and add new features and bug fixes nearly monthly i would 100 percent recommend :)"
5,Orchardcherries,"I first thought it would be an editing app where you have to pay for everything, but no! It’s all free and there’s great stuff too! It has better and more useful tools than other editing apps, and a lot of music choices. I love it. It can take a little to load when there is more images, so that’s one thing. But it also saves by itself, which can be very helpful. It has a few other tiny problems that could be fixed, but not too big of a deal. Overall, it’s a great app and definitely a 5 star rating."
3,Speed Battle is mid,"I’ve tried out CapCut for a while now and it was okay. Until an update came and screwed up the centering and sizing thing. If I try to move it, the thing moves out of the centering and I have to do the centering all over again. Not to mention the sizing messed up as well, when the blue bar on the side of the image is supposed to turn white and snap to the edge, it doesn’t do that. Instead, what it does is snap to random parts without the edge of the image on the edge of the format. I hope you fix this soon, cause I have a video I’d like to finish without any of these issues. Thanks! Take care."
5,Starxxs,"When I first started using CapCut, I had just started editing. CapCut is very user friendly and I was ably to learn very quickly. One of the best things about it is that all of the features are free and decently made. My only complaint is they don’t have some more basic trending effects such as hue shift and light scan aren’t available on the app. Custom masking also isn’t currently an option. Overall, I think CapCut is a great app for beginner editors to experiment with and is slowly becoming better and better for more advanced editors."
4,Misschronista,"OK, so this app honestly is really good and it has a lot of filters, effects, and transitions I like. However, my suggestion would be to add an option to lower the opacity of the effects. Some of the effects I love, but they are too bright. So I would like a lower opacity option for the effects. Honestly, this app is great but with a few updates/changes, this app could be a 5 star! Thank you for reading, and developers, if you are reading this. I think your app is great, just add some changes and I might change my review. Have a good morning/afternoon/night! 🌹"
4,vanix_9,"This app is amazing and you can do many things with how simple it is. I’ve been using the app for awhile now and the more I use it the more advanced things I figure out to do, but I feel so I’ve reached the end of this apps potential. One thing I am confused about is that I can’t copy a clip as an overlay, as the option is not highlighted. If I were to get this fixed I would be able to do sooooo much more with the app. I find myself doing the same thing over and over again, but if this problem was fixed I would be able to have so much more fun with the app."
4,4ubbb,"Review: CapCut is the best free editor for beginners who are learning how to edit!..- although if you’re more experienced with editing, you might want to move on to a more complex app/software. CapCut is more of the easy side of editing, with fewer options and effects.. which is why I would like to ask if CapCut would consider adding more complex effects.   Recommendations: -please, add more effects that are a bit more complex. -add a motion blur, this way you can make your videos more fluid and smooth to the eye. (If you can’t add any of these, it’s fine! I understand.)  Bug/glitch: One of the most annoying glitches in CapCut is when I add a video overlay, then reverse it… the overlay becomes glitched and some parts of the overlay have a black flash for a split second. I don’t know if it’s just me, but please try to fix this. Thank you.  Thank you for reading my review. I hope to hear back from CapCut soon!"
5,Radiostud484,"Hi, I just want to say that Capcut is amazing. I wanted to make videos on TikTok, and since TikTok does not have a lot of editing software, I started to look around and downloaded some video editor apps that seemed pretty good, but in all of them you could barely use any of the features without a subscription. I was getting frustrated because I just couldn’t find a good editor with free features. Capcut blew my mind. It has so many features and the are all for free, and they are perfect for TikTok. I am just 15 but I love this app and would recommend to anyone."
4,Galaxies2458,"So I like to use this app for edits, and it’s really amazing! It has good animation, effects, audio changing. There is just one main problem for me. For some reason the style option, and I checked for photo multiple times, is not available and is instead replaced with extract audio option. Idk if this is part of a later build or if it is a glitch, but pls bring back the style option! The 3d styles are main elements for my edits and they help my edits look smoother and more cooler. So if you can, pls consider bringing back the style option.  Thx!"
4,ro.mb101,"I like to edit tv shows, and CapCut is amazing for that. There are so many animation tools you can use and effects you can add--overall it's an amazing app. However, I don't like that on a video clip you can't do transitions both in and out without choosing from the combo section, but there are ways to solve that problem. And occasionally, when I want to add voice effects I can only do so by extracting a video or overlay audio, and that can sometimes get a little bit annoying. Still, the app is great for editing and I would definitely recommend!"
3,konnette,"I’ve used this app for a really long time and i love all of its features. it’s very intuitive and easy to use and the results are always what i picture in my head. one thing i dislike is that the style feature that allows you to do velocity automatically and cool 3D effects randomly disappeared. i used it one day and then the next the button wasn’t there anymore. i tried looking online for solutions but nothing worked. i unfortunately can’t do a lot of the edits i want to without this feature. i’m not sure why it’s not there anymore, but if it could be reimplemented that’d be great."
4,Charlotte💗🌈🌴,"I loved using this app when I began editing, now that im more advanced I would definitely recommend this app for editing! Its super easy to use and you can always end up with something pretty good! But there is a really bad glitch. It always says i have no internet and wont let me add animations are style my text. I have made sure to update the app. I also do have internet! But recently its just hasn’t been working! I do hope you can fix it, or have any suggestions on helping the glitch go away! But otherwise pretty decent app!"
4,LenLemony,"This is my favorite editing app! Great and easy to understand for any new editors, but I’ve noticed one odd bug while editing. Sometimes the animation feature for stickers and text doesn’t work. I’ll have an animation selected, but it won’t actually do the animation. I have to undo and redo it a few times for it to work. Sometimes I have to restart the app or delete the sticker and retry it. It would be great if this got fixed, otherwise I absolutely love the app! Don’t worry if you’re thinking about getting it, this doesn’t take away from the experience at all."
5,Niiiiiickkkknameee,Now I know the ones that cost money are just trying to make some money but it’s really helpful when you wanna try editing and stuff but you don’t have an editing app because they all kind of cost money most and the ones that do they have the good effects and stuff that you can’t get unless you pay CapCut has all of those for free and CapCut also is just straight up amazing I can’t even find the words to say how amazing it is I’ve had this app for months and it’s always been amazing I love it.
5,omg🔕🔳🃏🕑◽️🕐♠️♣️,"This app is by far the best editing app! (That I’ve used so far, I am trying some new ones though) What is really great about it is that it has no ads. Ads are very annoying especially if you use the app often like I do. If your looking for a good editing app to use, this is a good one! However, there are minor issues. There is a lot of really good beginner editing apps and this could be a good one! (I started out with KineMaster) I give this five because it has really good transitions (smooth ones) and really good effects, and more! :)"
4,Riley5679,Capcut is a really good editing app! But I wish it could be more like video star. It’s missing graphs! If they have graphs it would make the app so much better! That’s the only thing they need to make it a good app! CapCut is super easy to use! People say “It not a good app it has pre maid transitions.” That’s not the only you can do in CapCut you can do effects and other things. People are just not using the app right. You need practice you can say it’s a bad app without practice. Like I’m getting better at Capcut everyday! It’s a really good app everyone should you use for edits! All It needs is graphs and the app with blow up!
4,Caltech30,"First of all I love this app. I can edit my videos easily and quickly. Sometimes when I try to import something it says, could not import. This makes me frustrated because then I have to wait multiple hours to fix itself. And sometimes it will say insufficient storage try again later. So, I clean out all my old projects and camera roll. It still says that. I then have to wait over 24 hours for it to register. This makes me very sad because this is a great editing app but if there is anything I can do to fix or prevent this, then please let me know."
5,cherry....alex,"Cap cut is an amazing app but what annoys me sometimes is that sometimes it doesn’t let me trim how much I want to like let’s say it’s at 2.5 but it switches it self to 2.1 that’s what annoys me but other than that it’s an amazing app amazing effects transitions amazing amazing! You can also do velocity easily plus it doesn’t have a watermark like other apps for example funimate puts a watermark when you submit your video but not CapCut also is everything is free you don’t have to pay for anything yes, it also has key frames!"
5,gfgchgjg,"It’s a really easy editing app and they turn out really good however I do have an idea for another feature, because it takes so long to shorten a lot of pictures to the same length I think there should be a feature where you can select all the pictures you want to and shorten them to the same length at the same time ( and a select all feature if you add this) but even if the developer doesn’t see this it’s still a great editing app and I definitely recommend it! :)"
5,SaikaruTheBestNumber1,"This is by far my favourite editing app, because I do not have enough money to use other apps, and I love how there isnt a watermark, so my edits are much better. Its just, when I go to use the button called ""Animation"" it only lets me use ""In"" or ""Out"", never both. I dont know if its just the app, or if my phone isnt doing what its supposed to, but its become quite a problem because some edits require both ""In"" and ""Out"". I have Ios11 and would appreciate if you helped me, or if it actually wasnt implemented, just think about it."
5,BlueDinoGril4Life,"CapCut has brought me to a small roblox editing channel, of 41 subscribers. It’s a great app and it helps me with a lot of things, even happiness, believe it or not! Anyways, I do have some issues I would like to share. I only have 2 photos in my phone. Just 2. And CapCut is telling me storage is full. I do not understand why CapCut must make sure our storage is free before letting us create a video. I have deleted it and gotten in back over 15 times, and it will not stop telling me this. It’s the most annoying thing ever."
5,Puzzle_|^peace^|,"This is a genuine app, if you are looking to see if this app is a scam/ripoff, then read this! Everything is free, and there are no ads :)  Effects: I’ve had this app for quite a while, and it is truly amazing! You can adjust the effects however you’d like, not to mention the options are practically endless! Most apps have trashy little bursts of color and have you pay for it just to never use it and waste your money. A tip would be to download your video with your transitions, make a new project, import the video, and add in your major effects.    Key Frames:   You can click the “+” button to add your beginning position, and slowly move your object across the screen as you place the frames. This feature is extremely helpful, and you can adjust the speed of your object’s motion by pushing the frames closer together and moving the position farther.   consider downloading! :)"
5,M&J_Gaming (sub pls),"You should try out this app because there are many filters you can choose from, and tons of effects and layers! On my old app, InShot, you had to buy more effects, and there weren’t as many, and also, you couldn’t get to add overlays, or called the layers! CapCut gives you an opportunity to get tons of things that most apps don’t have! And I also recommend to get the app Filto, because, they have tons of pretty filters, and more! You should try both of the apps, it’s amazing!!!"
4,Hood_heffner,"I LOVE THIS APP I make edits all the time and this is the go to app for me it has everything I need and I love how you can have a lot of layers but unfortunately I updated it and anything I had before I updated it I can’t open, it tells me to update it after I already did and for the past 2 days I have failed to get any of my edits finished, I wish I can say I can remake the edits but I delete photos as soon as I use them and I don’t save anything unless I want to post to the public, I hope this gets fixed cause I would love to continue my progress, have a good day everyone 😁😁😁"
3,FIXIT2000,"This app is amazing compared to iMovie. It has so many features and it is great. The problem I have with it is that it tend to lag. When I’m don’t exporting my finished product, it delays the volume from the video which I then have to match it perfectly so it doesn’t lag. I’m tired of doing this and I need this to be fixed so I can use this more and not look for other edit apps. I really have an issuer where if I add too much footage it goes slower and slower which is super annoying because I guess it can only withstand a video that is a couple seconds long. The people who work on this app really need to fix these issues."
4,meeeeeeeeeeEereeeeeeeeeee no,"Keyframes were recently added, but there’s no way to customize the speed change/curve of the movement. Volume is hard to change, and the meter you use to change it doesn’t do much when you try to make it louder, and to make it quieter you have to almost go to ‘0’. Other than that, this app is amazing. There’s no watermark, and the transitions are pretty useful. The music they provide is copyright free, and sounds great. They’re constantly adding more and better features, and it’s very easy to use, would totally recommend"
5,karinnabet,"As transparent as I can possibly be, this app is amazing! I’ve been using it for business and personal use and it’s unlike any editing app I have! You can link TikTok sounds & you also don’t have to pay additional money for a “better package” like most other editing apps now in days. I recommend this if you wanna edit TikTok’s or Reels, videos like these will bring plenty of exposure to your business, I would recommend an app that’s easy to use for editing and this is definitely my #1 candidate right now"
5,slime PBJ slime,This App it is a good editing app for beginners but I’m not a beginner so it’s still good it’s really good and it doesn’t have good shakes so that’s like the only thing I am really need is the shakes to be good but other than that this app is like one of the best editing apps video star you have to pay for a lot of things so this is why are use capcut other than that I love the sound it’s really good at once you like start trying to use it it becomes really easy to use and once you know after like 3 or 4 days of learning you’ll be a pro
5,JABFPP,"I've been using Splice for over 4 and a half years, i was introduced to you guys the other day and haven't been able to stop editing since. I've legit already spent countless hours on some of my work and i must say, this is hands down, the easiest, smoothest and, most professional editing software i've ever gotten my hands on so far. Make's me wish it wasn't free because you folks deserve some cash! Thank you for quite the experience so far, can't wait to dish out some more content."
5,Tori121213,"I love this thing. It helps me edit animations and videos and such! My problem? Wish we had more layers! It’s sometimes hard to work with the limited amount of layers we have, so maybe some more would help especially since some animators found this fun to use! Also, the movements to keyframes, sometimes I just want to tilt an image, but then I accidentally resize it and it kills me, using a phone and all. If there is an easier was to resize and tilt images it would help A LOT! Thank you."
5,loucas16,"Hello there This application is so satisfying as I do make videos and teach language, this app is so creative and I like to work with . After a while working with this app it’s like it will get so many places and the history won’t clean up completely so I deleted the app and installed it again but after I did this I couldn’t use the animation feature and that’s made me sad as it was my method to teach the language and it was fun for kids to watch it, I hope you fix this problem ASAP, thanks anyway ."
5,wolfpack101339,This is an amazing app it has a lot of effects in it and has amazing quality and it dose not have ads it would be great if you had some more effects bc there already amazing just some more last night I made an edit of me and my bro and it was amazing the slow motion is amazing and I hope that you guys or you can make some more updates bc so far they are amazing I must bc really lucky that I found this app bc I use to use this over editing app and it was horrible thank you CapCut for making this amazing app👍🏽😁😆.
3,Alien beetle juice,I love this app it’s so easy but one day when I wanted to create something for my best friend it won’t let me! S I tried with some other photos and back it didn’t do it just because of photos! But then I tried it again with other photos and it worked. And so I tried getting the video that I want to pick and all the other photos and different things and it was done with the video but just not with the Photos. If the creator of the apps is this really try to fix this bug I want to surprise my friends for a gift! No I just went into it and it says that I have no photos on the videos!
5,AngelVxbes,"So I love using CapCut to edit vids. So my first suggestion is that you make CapCut available on computers. I have a gaming computer, and there are like no good editing apps for making an intro or editing vids, and CapCut is my number one editing app and for making an intro and outro. Another suggestion is that you can add songs such as Standby, Boy in the bubble, Let me down Slowly etc. Well these are all my suggestions and I hope that they get added to this app and make it more available on all devices!"
5,Kat The Doggo,"As an editor, I enjoy using this app and prefer it over many others. I haven’t used that many editing apps yet, but I used to only use iMovie and barely used KineMaster, CapCut was a huge upgrade from these apps! CapCut has many transitions, filters, effects, and more cool editing stuff! Oh great I’m starting to sound like an ad... From what I’ve seen so far, this app is completely free which is so great considering the multiple options you can use to make a video. I would suggest any beginner editors who want to make videos."
4,Lov like deku,This app is great for beginners that are trying to edit because it’s very simple and easy and it doesn’t take a long time to edit and you can upload all different stuff from this app instead of paying you don’t even have to pay completely free so I really like this app and I recommend people use this I don’t have any problems with it but sometimes while I’m making edits when I play the video it lags a  little but  once I upload it it’s fine but I struggle sometimes when I play it from there because it lags  a little overall it’s fine
4,please add these mods,Ok so why the title is “Why is this happening?” it is because when I do like an effect or an animation it says I don’t have internet when I do. I am trying to do an edit I don’t know what is wrong with capcut. I tried asking my friend but she said she was fine with capcut and nothing weird happened. Can you please tell me why capcut is acting like this I mean it never happened before. I was sad I couldn’t edit and I had to use another app to edit. I LOVE capcut it’s my favorite edit app I DON’T want to not use another editing app. Please tell me what is wrong like what can I do?
5,I download stuffs.,"Okay, so KineMaster is great and all, it’s got ads and an automatic watermark that you have to pay for to get rid of. The transitions are cool, but they don’t work on overlays. Now, CapCut is KineMaster, but better. I made a quick little test video, and it turned out wonderful. Compared to doing the same thing with KineMaster, CapCut really nailed it. Great editing tool, please don’t start making people pay for stuff like every other app did! Your app is great the way it is and I probably wouldn’t change a thing about it. Keep it up! :)"
5,Why is the stulee,"CapCut, why is the “styles” catalog gone? I really needed this to make my edits and post them. Now I can’t. Is this a glitch because of the new update or what? Because I’m very serious about this. I have no other app to edit with since others cost money. Others on tiktok or any other social app are wondering why y’all did this too, we all need the styles catalog. Please save this from our terror and let it back. Although cap cut is a good app so far! Thank you! ❤️ please feedback once you get this."
4,Im short like levi TwT,"I’ve been using capcut for over 5 months and it’s a really good app considering it’s free... however there aren’t a lot of fonts and updates and bug fixes aren’t great I’ve been having a problem where when I add a transparent photo the background turns white. When I try to remove the background it says there’s no background to remove, not to mention this app takes up way too much storage and I’ve had to give up so much for this app I’m beginning to think it’s not worth it, with that said please fix this bug, thank you 🙏"
5,grandmastermya,"Hi! I love this app. It has all the things you can do to edit your videos. But I do have some suggestions!!! #1, So when you replace a video, I think there should be an option to record a new one! Especially if your using a sound, and you didn’t lip sync correctly the first time. #2. I think you guys should add more effects, like hearts above your head, and much more. (Idk if you have that effect already lol) that’s all I have to say, and I hope somebody see this! Have a great rest of your day/night."
4,Drudolphreese,"This app is great better than any other app that I’ve tried to use! But one problem is that on the part where you could add know text,After you add the text there’s effects, bubbles, ETC-but the problem is when I press an affect or a bubble I have to take a wild guess because it doesn’t show what the effect is and when I press it it says no Internet connection but I checked my Internet in my settings and I sure do you have Internet so if you read this or see this anyone could you please update me or tell me what’s happening?"
5,nay nay period🤬,CapCut is a nice app but like many reviews I hate how it says out of storage I delete all my photos and videos and it’s kinda annoying and correct me if I’m wrong but when I make like a long video it loads so slow and my phone sometimes be at 5% but on the good side I love the ✨ sparkle✨ affects their so fun to use and I got some suggestions like on shortcut I don’t love the Music and when it says to go to A music app and I don’t have a Music app But the The other option is amazing thank you for your time bye 👋
5,Ava3728283,"CapCut is great! It’s easy to use and the transitions are smooth and great! I always post edits on CapCut since it’s just amazing. You can change the frame rate and quality? And there’s no watermark. It’s awesome! But many people say CapCut isn’t an editing app since you choose the transitions instead of making them. So here’s some requests. We should be able to make our own transitions and use graphs. If you did that, you’d probably get many more people to get it, and less hate. This app is amazing and if anyone is reading this, GET IT!!"
4,Not for us Trump :),It’s really good to edit with as a bigger editor and get to use it more and stuff but a big problem I have is when it says “my storage is low and I won’t be able to edit anymore tell my storage is clear” my storage is at 3.7(something) rn I have have enough room I understand when my storage is at like 4.7 (something) but it kinda gets annoying from time to time every now and again. But besides this it’s alright to use. Why I say that is because I have no idea how to use video star or even alright motion so Capcut is my go to app for editing.
5,showstopper891,Omg this is like my favorite app ever! I love all the new green screen features and I love the editing tools! There are so many amazing options! I also love the templates!!! They are so easy to use you just pick pictures and it does the work for you!!! I can’t express how much I love this app!💕 I would love to see the “what do you meme” filter added! That would be so cool🫶overall amazing. And for any parents wondering if this app is okay for your kids… You can not talk to anyone nor post videos for people. So overall AMAZING app!!!!!🔥
5,🥳🤩🤪😋😇🙁☹️🥺yay!,"Dear CapCut editors,       I love this app sooo much. Honestly it’s the best photo/video editor out there. Please start adding more features and fix the gifs please. I thought that I would be able to actually put real gifs into my videos. When I did what the instructions said, it told me to do something that’s always been there. It told me how to add stickers from my photos into videos. This made me feel very disappointed about something I was looking forward to. I hope you liked this feedback."
3,Addison Vevas,"I love capcut so much but it’s just so annoying at some times. For example, texts are getting deleted without me deleting them, storage always full when it isn’t even close to being full, it doesn’t delete the text or overlay, or whatever when you want it too, it isn’t even an editing app like sure it added graphs but their pre-transitions and the only transitions that aren’t premade are the basic ones: rotate, position and scale. Nothing else. and people call it an editing app. Fandom? Through the roof, but in a bad way. Attacking others for having an opinion. I can’t even with them."
5,Josie-craft,"So, this is an amazing app, I love all the filters and effects and the fact you can extract things, but there is this one glitch where I tap on photos and there is no photos. When this happens I close thy app and go back in, sometimes it works, sometimes not. Also it would be cool if you could like edit an audio a little more? I know you can change the volume and speed, but I feel like I need something else. But otherwise thank you for this beautiful app!"
5,Beastplays 21,"Hello CapCut, your app is very good. I love using it to make edits. It’s really simple and fun to use. It’s better than most. Expect somethings I think you guys should add are like more effects like: motion blur. I would really like if you guys can make changes to the speed so when I put the speed at 0.9x or slower it’s not as choppy and looks more smooth. And I would also want more creative fonts. A bigger storage for editing. Add more things to help the quality like “adjust”. Thanks for listening, Zamentic"
3,knock my name,CapCut  can you please  fix the thing we’re it say like to much storage Bc I’m losing apps and it’s making it hard Bc I ned those apps and if that keeps happening I’m going to have to delete the apps I do homework with and that’s not good for me so please I’m beginning you to fix this also if I try to go back to a. Project it’s gonna say like you have no more storage clean up some phone space and I just got that and that project took me a long time to make and I had a green screen so I had to keep changing the background for all the pictures and I had 28 or 20 something and I’m pretty frustrated with it 😅so please fix this CapCut
5,by: the,"1st of all I really love the app, it helps me a lot, but could u guys just add these 2 things I'm asking for? 1st thing: when we want to add an audio, can you please add a search button to look for the music we want please. 2nd: this is the last thing I'm asking but could u please add a thing where we can color on the pictures we want, bcs there is this 1 picture I need to color on so could u please please please please!!!! Add these 2 things? That's all I'm asking for!!!! Please and Thank u!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸"
5,¡nope!,"I love capcut and have used it for a year now. It is so easy to use and quick to learn; however, I lost part of the update from 3 days ago.   I’m not sure if anyone else is having this issue, but I can no longer access the glowing boarder added in the what I believe was the latest update. If you removed this feature then that makes more sense. But I would still like to understand what happened, and why I am not able to use it like I could just yesterday."
5,vyurio,"I love this app, the watermark at the end instead of in the clips is great, I love the filter as well, but maybe the transitions could be better? Or more maybe. Perhaps add more options to add more than 1 movement at a time. I would like to better more if there are new or better transitions, like smooth or options with the key frames making them a bit more smoother to use for smooth transitions to different clips? Overall it’s a great app, thank you for reading, I appreciate it."
5,kstrizzle_07,"This app is freaking perfect for any person trying to start making edits, yet the app has so much to offer that you can use this as your main app and need nothing else. The animations make it look as if it is from Adobe after effects and with no watermark either. You can use keyframes too, although I would like to request for CapCut to have the option add different easing to the keyframes, although not necessary. But again, love it, really easy, and I would recommend it."
4,jerlove100%,"CapCut is amazing I love it it has everything you would want in a editing app but after 2 or 3 edits it stopped letting me add photos it would only let me add photos in the preview I tried hitting the plus replacing it nothing worked so I stopped using it ,if they fixed this glitch I would use it so much more but until they fix it I will only use it like once a week or so and not even finish the edit their is also a recommendation I would have you should add more filters and animations I can’t really think of any examples but it would really help in variety"
5,TheLearningMaster,"This app is so great! You can edit your videos fairly easily with no adds or watermark which is kind of a big deal considering I’ve seen editing apps full of ads and that have watermarks that are much worse quality. Obviously nothing is perfect but the only thing I have a suggestion about is just maybe labeling or giving some directions because even I have found it is kinda hard to tell what does what. Otherwise, I really love this app and you should 100% download it for editing!"
4,Kid Kellz,"Great app, best transition effects and UI on the market. But unlike VN, where you can control image duration for 1/100th of a second and time up your shots perfectly, here you can only control image duration to tenth of a second. This just isn’t enough for what people want to do with your app, like produce photo/video content that syncs with a user’s audio. Please guys, I can’t use this app for my content because of it. All I ask is that you expand this functionality so that your app can be used to the best of its ability. Thank you very much"
5,i dout have boold,"Please make more transitions! I would love to have more As I am An instagram editor But other than some lagging I absolutely love this app! It does lag time to time when adding too much effects but I love the animations,the transitions and the effects! Wish you could add more camera transitions and animations too! Like more 3D animations and there is no watermark. I was very shock that this app is completely free I love that it provides a lot of aesthetic things too! I would rant more But all I got to say is this is one of the best apps!"
4,savgirl2020,"One thing tho if u have this app then yk that u can do “shortcuts” and I like using those they r very helpful but some of the music On them is kinda weird. ikkk u can change the music but I think it ppl would like and use the shortcuts more if they they were kinda like those tiktoks that ppl make and mayb u could use some of those is u got permission IDK or just make yr own CapCut😂😂  Btw my favvvv shortcuts is the song where it says “ you know that I won’t stop until I make you mine, until I make you mine” then after that part in the song it gets slow like THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABT MAKE MORE SHORTCUTS LIKE THAT PLZZZZZ"
5,Droggu,"I haven’t seen a video editing app with as much features as this one on a mobile market. Not to mention everything is free. You literally are given tools that are able to create beautiful videos. This app is as good as you are, because the sky is the limit. There’s only one feature I wish this app had was a more in depth audio editor like an equalizer. That’s the only weak part of this app. There’s features on this app you won’t see anywhere else."
4,Brooklyn 💜🖤💜🖤,"I have fixed the issue (using a bunch of storage for this app) but i think you guys can fix jt for others. This app is wonderful and even without paying its amazing, an app like no other. But unfortunately when i first had the app it had 7 gigs taken just for fonts, effects, filters, and then the basic things which I think is unbelievable. It is mostly my fault but if developers can help or fix this please do. Besides that, this app is amazing and I wont be changing editing apps for a while."
4,Ambriitz,"It’s a amazing, but I give it four stars because, I am not fully sure it’s a bug or just me. but when I was gonna make a new video. It said I had no storage, so I deleted some videos. Then it STILL said I had some bad storage then I ended up deleting all my work in Capcut. And guess what? It still said the storage wasent enough. I also tried to fix it by doing the settings things, and I had to restart it over and over again. I really want fixed. If it’s fixed I would be really happy and can work on my videos again. thank you so much <3"
3,Layrobloxgamer✨✌🏽,"Hi, cap cut needs some work. I mean it’s a amazing great app and I use it to practice editing but, I had to delete a bit of files to get cap cut back for me to edit which to me is SUPER annoying. And every time I make a kinda long video/edit it says “To much storage, try again later.” And I try again later and it says the same thing I mean, I delete some of the apps on my phone but after that still needs me to continue deleting everything. If anyone wants this review to go up to a 5 star I really need this fixed because I am almost out of games to play on my phone. Thank you for reading ✌🏽😄"
3,glittergirl1555,I’m a love editing so I got this app cause my friends recommended to me and so I’m like it can’t be that bad so I go in and I make like 2 or 3 edits and what I go and get the film I will use for the edit and then I go back in and I press news edit and it’s like you need to delete photos so I did I deleted 267 photos and it still said it so I did it again and it still said it and I was like ok well I will deleted the app and get it again so I try clicking on it and it say you can’t edit till you delete photos so I’m so mad because I take hours on my edits but it’s just gone and I will try again but it won’t work I know it
4,tornado127699,CapCut is an amazing editing app and I have been using it the past year for lots of things. Something I loved to use was the fun sound effects that added comedy to my videos! Over the past couple weeks I have noticed I’m not able to do it anymore because the app says “No internet. Connect to the internet to try again” even when I am connected to the internet it will not go away so I have been unable to use CapCut to its full capabilities. Please let me know if there is anyway to fix this but besides that it is truly an amazing app!
5,dúgXgirl,"I really enjoy this app it helps a lot for my vids and edits but there is a few things that should be added but since I don’t want to overwhelm you or anything lm just going to name one… so lm starting a new video idea and it involves that voice sound thing.. l hope you know what l mean but l was thinking could you add more voices? It gets kinda boring and annoying with three voices… so you should add more especially the male, and you don’t have to add a whole bunch of voices maybe just one or two.. thank you!"
5,🅰️hello,"CapCut is so amazing! It has every advanced feature I would expect from an app I would have to pay for! I still cant believe this is free because its just so good!! It has no ads either by the way. i love capcut because it has all the basics and more, u can remove the background and put in whatever you want and its soooo good for making superhero movies with alll the effects and the stickers. thankyou so much to the people who made capcut, your amazing thank you. would 10/10 DEFINITELY recommend. 👌😊🙂 love your app!"
4,fhrxjrnsnfbz,"I started using this in 2020 in June and it was going really great. That is until a tiny problem happened in 2021 April 23. I was working on a edit when, I was trying to put an audio in. The problem was when it loaded it freezed and no audio came on the edit. Mind you it was a really special edit for someone and I really wanted to get it done that day. So I tried it again and it still wouldn’t work I reset it and everything. I’m gonna try to delete it and install it back. Hopefully it works! Other then that the app is really good."
5,maisha_may1,"This is the first time I have ever written a review for an app but this deserves 5 stars because of how fantastic this app is! There is no watermark and it has all the features you are looking for in one app. This app is so easy to edit and create videos it's astonishing. There are many effects and wonderful transitions. Lastly, one feature I love is the auto caption feature, it writes the text of the audio and you are able to customize it any way you want! Once again get this app it's the best video editing app ever 👍"
5,808Percent,"One thing that I would suggest for the developers is to allow more “freedom” within the app (in my case I just want to be able to rotate the “split” mask diagonally). I feel like letting users modify the masks and effects to fit their needs would greatly increase your number of consumers because unlike other video editing apps, I like that you have great effects and editing tools all laid out for free. (Edit I just found out how to do that. I am very pleased with this app 10/10 will always recommend)"
5,Nataly🌶🩸,"I’ve been using capcut since 2020 in every new device that I get capcut is very good it helps a lot since I’m learning how to edit more and more everyday. But can we get Velocity please  I would really appreciate that. Also,Sometimes when I’m editing And I press to see another edit The edit that I was editing before goes to the bottom so can you pleaseeeeee Put a thing that reminds us the edit we where working on.I think Everyone Should Honestly Get this app it’s free and No ads❤️."
5,Jelly_The1andOnly,"I have never really tried to edit stuff, and when I found Cap Cut, that changed. It’s pretty easy to use, and  even if you don’t have tiktok, you get lots a songs to choose from.  Have been using it for about a year now, so I have gotten the hang of it. There is only one thing I don’t like about it, I wish you could also just put the fun fonts of photos, not just videos, but there are so many other apps for that, so I don’t mind. Thank you soo much for creating Cap Cut, it’s amazing!"
3,overlay limit,So basically I am a ROBLOX story time maker and I was making a story and I was adding my I think six characters and just immediately I just said that my overlays are done I can’t use them anymore and I’m gonna need the overlay so I can finish it and I just have to keep going to a separate project so I can finish it and I do not like agree that I should do this Cuz it’s kind of annoying and what’s the point of like having to use CapCut for the overlays like I might as well use it for the text instead of the overlays if it’s gonna have a limit because I can’t deal with making a new project so I can just add the overlays
5,^yeet_786^,"I was trying to edit a video for a project but these other editing platforms would glitch out or make me pay for almost all the features. CapCut, on the other hand, let me edit the video easily on my phone, and I had zero, I repeat, zero problems with it. It didn’t even take me long! You don’t have to pay for anything, you can easily use the features, it’s easy to navigate, and you can remove the watermark, too. I’m very satisfied and love this app already! :)"
4,leahhhhhhhhhhha,"I really like to use CapCut to make gacha videos alongside Kinemaster! And it’s really helpful when it has something Kinemaster doesn’t. But, today I was making a gacha video and I added in the audio right after I added the photos. Once I adjusted the photos to my liking I was gonna ad an overlay, but when I clicked the overlay button the only thing I could add were videos and stock videos. When I tried to add more photos it wouldn’t let me. This has happened multiple times and it’s really annoying to deal with."
4,Lil ly YT,So I make content using CapCut to edit. I was trying to put a photo like normal (I couldn’t remove it and put it back or it would ruin the video) and it would do it BUT SO SLOWLY! And the sensitivity just seemingly went up a lot. I tried closing the app and restarting my phone but nothing happened. I spent 30 minutes trying to do something that would normally take less then 1. There is also times where if there is a lot of photos it won’t pick up all of them unless you save the video.
5,Cj_da_bagel :3,"I love this app because of three main reasons:  1. It’s completely free! There’s no hidden or revealed in-app purchases! All the other apps I found in the App Store either cost money to download or something in the app cost money, like the soundtracks, effects, filters, animations, etc. This app has a lot to offer, and all for free!  2. The fact that you can extract sound from videos! I like to make songs on GarageBand and screen-record them, then extract the audio so I can put it to my pictures or other edits in CapCut. Other apps either make you pay to unlock the extract feature, or just don’t have it all together! Plus, CapCut makes the process easy to add my favorite audio!  3. The effects, filters, and animation! There could be a little bit more body effects, but other than that, the animations as a whole are stunning!"
5,King Bakugou,Hey so i hope your reading this message well I wanted to say that CapCut is a great app it’s amazing! No water mark and everything is free but… I would love for you to add more transitions like a hand transitions where a hand slides over it and it changes to the next picture? I would love for you to add that also I wanted to ask is there any premium (why am I asking this it’s all free lol) also I love chroma key! It doesn’t show the green screen/ pink screen well that’s all from me! Edit: also please ADD GRAPHS
5,aboynous,"I’ve been an editor for a year now, wondering how in the world everyone had been improving on their anime edits and fan edits yet I was stuck in the mud with barely any good apps AT ALL! Capcut is completely free and basically water mark free too. It’s crazy how amazing and wide spread this app is, you can NEVER get bored!! Every edit I make on this app makes me so happy because I am finally improving as an editor after months of trying with the same bad apps! Thank you for the developers who made this app!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! 🤧❤️"
3,sarahh.luvx,"Don’t get me wrong, this app is AMAZING. But a lot of the time it says I need to free up storage, I literally delete 100 photos just for it to work and it doesn’t even let me use it! I love it but I really want it fixing right now.  Next thing is that maybe add more transitions because I want to look for the one I want since I can’t use videostar or other apps I don’t know how to edit with. The next thing is that PLEASE add more songs because some are really bad and if I want to make my own song I have to screen record and do it but over all this app is alright but it just needs a lot more work done to it."
4,hi822224,"I honestly want to start off by saying capcut is a really good app for editors, or anyone who is looking to go into the editing stage I do have minor problems with capcut the glitches,lagging,storage of your reading this capcut please please PLEASE make us have a log in account so whenever the app is deleted we can have an account to log back into to see our old things we done on the app that’s the only thing I want I don’t like how when we reinstall the app there’s no log in which means everything is loss please take this idea into consideration 🙏"
5,hahahahahahahahahaaaaaahaa,"I’m an editor and I love this app sm!! Not very good for transitions but it’s still amazing for any other type of edit. The only thing I would suggest is adding in folders so that you can categorize your edits. I have a lot of edits I think like over 150 and it’s rlly hard to find the one I’m trying to find. Also I edit all different sorts of things and it would be great to have like one folder of unfinished stuff one folder of finished stuff, stuff like that would make it a lot easier to use. 👍👍"
5,J-Dog51,"Capcut is, out of all the editing apps I have used, simply the best. Capcut is 100% free plus there are no ads to stop you while using it. It offers more features than any editing app I have used, plus new ones being added often. It is also extremely user friendly and only takes minutes to learn. Overall I HIGHLY recommend this app if you are an inspiring video creator or just someone who needs to put video clips together."
5,Pixie The Tiny Little Princess,I think that this app is very amazing for beginners such as myself! The controls are very easy and understanding and there is no confusion whatsoever. This was my first editing app and I got so excited for the shakes and the shakes are very easy to understand. Capcut also has audios and sounds. Sound effects and also music! The sound effects are very realistic and I love them a lot. The overlays are absolutely stunning and the green screens work very well I definitely recommend using this app for a green screens!!
5,HDR 16,"After all the videos I used to make compared to this apps videos. What a big difference, there’s amazing effects, frames, you can remove background add stickers and overlay. You can transition and add speed, volume, contrast. Create amazing videos! My go-to! I love it so much! Don’t chance a thing, it’s PERFECT. When you save, everything is clear, this app is very user friendly! It  doesn't have a watermark except at the end, which is totally fine! Amazing app! Get it now :)"
5,Nombrilista,"I have an idea. Well we should have an option for different levels of editing, you could have modes like “self crop” and i thought of an “effect” called scribble! It lets you take a clip that has some time of animation in it (affect animation or intro) it lets you take the animation or shake from the video and put it in to yours. Say if i wanted my clip to slide up and down but I couldn’t because there was no animation for it, i could add the clip of the animation and it would put it on. Tell me what you think <3"
5,starmiist,"I don’t normally write reviews,  but I just had to say how much I adore this app that gives us quality editing tools and it’s all FREE. I’ve already made a few edits with it and my favorite part is definitely the ready-to-go transitions and effects that make it fun and easy for beginners (like myself). The only thing I wish for is more transitions for the In and Out options, and I want to be able to use them both on a single clip. Other than that, great app! Keep up the work!"
5,Om6ia776556,"This app is amazing! Other than the fact of me adding an effect to my gacha video and everything messing up this is by far the best editing app I’ve used for anything! I would 100% recommend downloading! Now, it may take a while to master it and understand how it works but once you get the hang of it it’s easy as a piece of cake! Y’all better not be using it for mean edits! Show some support to this amazing app and enjoy your creations!"
2,Blendin101,Listen the app is really good and great for editing but every time I have to restart my phone like8 times for it to work it would say full storage then I deleted all my photos and it still says it I delete my recent projects and it still says it thanks a lot now I have no photos and no recent projects I’m deleting it now! Update: yes I’m back editing my review… this is a problem I have plenty of storage and I keep deleting and downloading again guess what? Didn’t work. And I have to keep restarting my phone which you guessed it.. it still doesn’t work even tho I have to pay I’m switching to video star I’m deleting this app for good.
5,AngelicxGiselle,"Hi Capcut! I have a few suggestions for this app how it can upgrade on everybody's editing more -  1. Motion Blur  Motion blur is very much of good way of having a smooth transitions and shakes, so it won’t have to be so sloppy  2. More shakes  I like the shakes that we have now, but I think it’s that time of day that I ask for QR CODES, so instead of having to do different things for shakes, we can have QR codes.  3. Graphs  Graphs are the most important thing I suggest, so other editors can actually do more time on their editing, and make their own shakes, think of it as Videostar!   Last thing, 4. Smooth slow-mo, more leveling effects, and upgrading editing  All of these is something that would be really amazing to have, so it will be very good if we can have these last 4 things.  But that’s all! overall, I really enjoy this app!"
5,ZAOUYYT,"Honestly. The apple itself is pretty good upgrade if your going from for example kinemaster / imovie to CapCut. It has no watermarks and gives you more transitions and effects / animations. Definitely hope that they could make it so that you could stack up animations instead of doing them and then export, edit again in CapCut. Export. Do it again. However honestly the app itself is amazing. No doubts about that and definitely hope that they won’t make a paywall for a removal of watermark or something."
5,edit.02'b!,"I LOVE CAPCUT. But even though I love it I think there could be some changes to it. First I think loops would be really good for animations and help out a lot of people. I also think that editors should get more options in animation “in” and “out” because there is not many choices and they kinda limit editors on their options. Final addition capcut should add is more stock videos, more stock videos can probably help beginners add more to their videos and make them better."
3,duoshsjckfndkssnnddkxkcnfjs,"I don’t like it kinda because it don’t have a lot of edits. Also, why can’t y’all put a search for the music and, not from the gallery because, we might not have the song and have to go get the song. Also, I feel like y’all should have a lot more stuff. A lot of the editing stuff I have on my phone has a lot of stuff to do. I tried to do a edit but, there was not a lot of stuff as I imagined there was going to be. It was hard for me to find out where stuff was. I am new to this I haven’t explored all of it yet. But, that is all I needed to tell for y’all to fix and get more stuff."
1,Codie Depollo,"First off, I can’t even find the sounds I want to use. There’s not even a search option to even look for certain songs you want to use. It only shows original sounds that people made on TikTok!  Secondly, the option to make the lyrics appear on-screen while the audio plays is not present, so how do other people have this feature?! And if it even gets added, it won’t even work!  I would give this app 5 stars if it actually works the way other users get it to work, but I’m sorry. I had to give it 1 star because it is so difficult to use. I recommend a more easier to use app like iMovie or FilmoraGo. Those apps actually work as advertised, this doesn’t…."
4,0_0 EJDaGoat 0_0,"I love using CapCut. As a TikTok content creator; this app has allowed me to edit videos at a professional level without having to worry about paying for a monthly subscription. I fell in love with the app as soon as I saw we are able to remove the watermarks. I plan to use CapCut a lot in the future. My only complaint is sometimes when I insert a-lot of pictures, the app removes some from the frames, leaving me with blank spaces or frozen screens. Other than that, this app is perfect, simple to use, and professionally set up and designed. Thank you CapCut!"
5,Wolfy Molly,"(Yes this is a real review I’m not a bot :3) This app is AMAZING once you learn how to use it well, they add updates frequently and they have multiple options. They also have a chroma key which allows you to have whatever background you want (if you have a green screen, pink screen, blue screen etc.) Awesome. It’s also completely free! No annoying ads will interrupt you while editing, and you can remove the watermark for free! It’s amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ five stars. Definitely recommend this to new editors!"
4,snjdndpndodneo wjd,"I’ve been using CapCut for years, it’s a great app and it’s so easy to use!! It’s the easiest editing app I’ve ever used but there’s one problem that I’m just starting to notice.. Whenever I make videos and add a lot of cuts and clips it starts glitching and won’t play some clips, it’ll just skip them or be stuck on one clip. It’s been doing this for 2 months or so, I’ve swiped the tab and exited the video then re entering it and it still does this. I’m not sure why, the app doesn’t need to update. Please fix this as soon as possible!!!!"
4,This app is useful.,"So, I've been making videos on this app for about 4 months now. An excellent app, that I really like using and is very easy to understand. But I do have problems with exporting and some glitches, for example when exporting a 20 minute video, I had little clips with text. After exporting and checking the video the clips had scatter into different parts of the video. If they could change this glitch it would be very appreciated, thank you for reading!"
3,gacha-Bella,I love this app and I use it for all my edits but I hate that everything has to face forward. I don’t really know how to explain but for exmple everyone knows about the Nagito edit that blew up and the Miu Iruma big juicy edit. Thoes edits were fantastic but they used apps like ae and alightmotion because in capcut u Canot put things to an angle which is very annoying. For example if I was making an edit and I needed a Circle to turn for the bg but it was supposed to be facing upwards I would have to use a different app because even with the key frames I can only turn it certain ways.
4,kidviolet,The reason i gave this app 4 stars is because why cant u add two pics and make it look like its MOVINGGGGGG AGH but although i love this app it might need more effects like “fade“ so u make it look like it dissapeared. And also custom music so u can choose music from ur library and why does it say the copyright thing and its protected IDKKKKKKK WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY but this app so far is GREAT i got this app from my friend? Idk if she my friend still but i got this app from my friend and so far im using to edit my gacha club vids and like videos! Thank u for reading my review bye! Stay safe and were ur mask!
5,lol #6,So I like to edit stuff and this app is great it has everything! Text to cool stickers also you can remove the watermark and the app isn’t constantly asking you to pay for something! Also if you want to make a quick edit you can just insert photos/videos and boom a edit! Also if you don’t have tik tok (like me) then all the cool filters are in there!!! Including time warp (my fav) and a bunch more!! Download the app sooo many pros and not very many cons!!! Tysm for reading hope it helps bye!
5,bffs💕,Hi CapCut makers and creators I love your app so much it was the best decision I have ever made for an app it is completely free love the editing and so much more I love that you can create audio from one of your videos this app got me so inspired if you are a person looking at the reviews before getting an app I WOULD RECOMMEND so much thank u for reading this if you get a chance !😄 (update) : still love the app thanks soooo much for the more advanced transitions can you PLEASE make more I’d love that so much for my edits
5,lolspotify,"so when i got capcut i was generally new at editing and it was surprisingly easy to make good looking edits so quickly. i still use capcut BUT as a growing editor i think that there should be smoother slo-mos, velocity, and graphs should definitely be added. more effects and overlays would be amazing as well. other than that i really don’t have a problem with the app. it’s a good beginner and more advanced editing app. it’s free and no watermark. i definitely recommend :))"
5,Eli & gabe,"i use capcut and you know! There might be bad storage problems, but i really still like the app! I make amazing edits on there and its just so helpful for me because all i used to have was clips and I didnt make things to call an edit, but because of capcut and can make an edit that’s actually decent, now if you want a app with kinda easy controls then download capcut, but if you want a little bit on confusion then download video star and video star +. + costs money and the regular one is free. Goodbye!!"
4,shinobou保护,This app is so good but i wish they had like better translitions or you could make your own translitins.. like you can make ur own custom translition and add like motion blur too it or you could add more than 1 translition at a time. another problem i have is storage. i have a lot of free storage and even on other apps it says i have enough storage to edit but all the time on here it says i have low storage.. Please figure that glitch out! and i wish you could add more overlays too or even add more voices for the text speech  thanks for listening
5,Senior Clxwn Adam,"This app is amazing! <3 it’s good for beginners! :D and perfect for making Gacha memes and movies! I never knew about this app until my very old friend in tiktok told me about this. She would make edits of Addison Rae. I asked her what app she uses, she told me it’s capcut! I’ve tried many editing apps since I make gacha mini movies, music videos, memes etc! For myself and this is the best one I found! It’s effects are really good! :D it also has no watermark imao. I will definitely use this app to make more gacha memes/movies in the future for myself! :D"
3,Br0ken_granny,So capcut is awesome I've been using this app for a while but I don't know why they removed velocity because once they added that feature it was really good and made my edits perfect but once they removed it every thing kept saying I have bad wifi although I have full bars also that now when you want a specific effect won't let you put it on there nothing cost money which is very good it's just it needs a whole bunch of wifi and just asking why they had to remove velocity if the creator can respond back and tell me why that would be good.
5,Mariolank,"I love this app, but i've been getting so much bugs and glitches in this app because It wouldn't load for me and wouldn't play the video at all. this app is also super slow for me too. I was using this app for editing and this app is extremely slow. when I add cuts into my video i'm editing it really chugs and stops the video sometimes and would crash the app. I really wish you guys could fix your app and patch most of the things I mentioned."
5,Aniime•youtube,Okay so I love how this doesn’t have premium and no watermark and you can delete the end but please add more effects like ghost effects! and some more effects! I really loved the old CapCut too bc it had effects I like so I’d bring it back but If no please add more effects if you know roblox edits they are amazing so could you add some more effects so if you don’t know roblox edits watch them! And I want you to add some of the effects you see in roblox edits! Really great app!
5,WHY ARE THE NICK NAMES TAKEN,So some apps like Zoomerang and this (capcut) won’t let me access camera or photos cuz it says that I need to allow it then I press confirm or whatever it says and it brings me to settings where I can allow it but there is no choice for photos or camera so I don’t know if it has to do with my phone or the apps but I’m really sad cuz I spend a lot of time making edits and this is the best app for that so I just want to know if anyone else has had this problem
5,😮🥖😅🍕😁👌👻👌,"FIRST of all- this is one of the best apps ever, I use it a lot to edit my vids for yt! :) you can pretty much do everything for FREE, Not even any ADDS. I am not kidding you can get so much for free and no adds, COUNT me in. Now this editing app is mostly a beginner app but if ur not good at editing you won’t see a notice. This has so many nice animation, transitions, effects, and if u just search up CapCut edits you will so many amazing edits people made from this app. Get it, it’s worth ur time and very easy to follow :) -Sah"
4,MK_awesome,I’m trying to make an edit as one does with this app but it’s really glitchy. At one point I couldn’t see the photos in the bar things at the bottom they were just black and also it’s lag is awful for me. I was trying to add a transition to part of it and it was super laggy and was taking about 10 seconds to even add the transition. the same thing happens when I try to adjust the length of a photo or video. Aside from that I really love this app. If these glitches were fixed i’d be very happy.
5,wertywasedy,"I love this app and all, but there is a bug that is very crucial. I was creating a project (under a minute) and I put a lot of pictures in it. When I left the app and reopened it, I couldn't open my project at all. I tried everything. Offloading the app, creating duplicates, restarting my device, nothing works. I could even open all the other projects, but just not that one. I'm really frustrated and I can't restart the whole project because it's too long. Please fix this problem."
5,ZenModeling,"So I've been paying $5 a month for the past 3 years for a Video Editing App that has it all!!! Recently I spent 9+ hours on my largest video with the most editing, only to have the App crash EVERYTIME I tried to transfer it to my Photo/Video storage...🙄😡 So I came across this new App & noticed it contains the same editing features as the $5 deal... & this one is FREE..... So Far So Good... I keep waiting for it to let me down- but SO FAR SO GOOD...  Let's Hope I can say bye bye to that old App & HELLO to the $60 a yr this app will save me... ☯️ZenModeling☯️"
4,Necessary info,"So I downloaded CapCut to edit pictures and videos and when I try to cut a scene short but end up not liking it, it’s to short to change because of the transition lines, and I have to start all my hard work over again. So I really think what you guys should do is make transition like animation, so when you press the edit it has transition and animation and ect, but overall this app is great! Just that the white transition lines can be in the way when your trying to delete a short mistake."
5,@@@iii@@@,"Phenomenal app. It does lag but it’s reasonable, the best parts are they way it’s free and how easy it literally is to use, and your edits can be amazingly good if you’re even creative enough and getting used to it enough. Only problem are updates, you guys could make a lot more better stuff editors could use like smoother animations instead of random stuff, one of my suggestion is that you guys work on adding more font styles for text just like kind-master."
5,sami the Best roblox player,"This review will be short but i’d just like to say this app is awesome, it has great edit options it seem like over 1000 and it gives you recommendations and gives you copyright free music from all genres  it is great whether your making an edit for social media or just making a personal video for fun. I greatly recommend it! And with all the options it may seem confusing but just watch some tutorials and it will be easier then it looks! Great app!"
4,isabelleese,"capcut is literally the best editing app ever for beginner editors! i’ve used this app for about 4 months now and it’s brought my channel to 20k subs 💗 but from the pass couple months capcut STOPPED working. i didn’t do anything, but one day i join capcut to make an edit and everything i press says “no internet connection” i’ve watched many videos to fix this problem and they all involve VPNS which i don’t think i should have to install to get back to capcut. i just really hope capcut can fix this problem soon.."
4,BriDavie,So I started using the app and everything worked fine for about a week and the I tried to make and edit and every time I add a new picture after the first image a screen shows up that says and text and I can’t get rid of it. So now every time you watch the edit to see what it looks like on the second screen it just says “Add text here” right in the middle of the screen and I never even put a text bubble there and it will not go away. Please fix this.
5,CapCut is magnificent,"Hello to whoever is reading this or the creators who might be reading this but probably aren’t- You guys did an amazing job at creating this free-in-all video editing app! It surely is amazing and probably the best one out there, I love the stickers, how you can use green screen with it, the overlays, and all the affects! This app.. Its a masterpiece!!!! The features, it’s free, the affects are awesome, the stickers are too and you can do practically anything with this app! I really recommend downloading it 🥰😋😊😌"
4,100000000 Unicorns,"It says I don’t have enough storage. I asked my friend and she doesn’t know. I haven’t even made a video yet. I don’t know what’s going on. I have enough storage though so I don’t know why it’s telling to get rid of some photos or stuff. I don’t have max photos, I can still take photos, I tried resetting my iPad nothing happens. So now I can’t make videos until I “clear out my photo album”. I’m new here or to this app so I don’t know most of the features. I’m really disappointed and would like a response with help."
4,pianist9830,"This app is great because ⟟ make videos for fun but ⟟ would like to be able to see it on other devices like my iPad. I think you could make accounts and we’d all have the same things but so ⟟ can watch it on other devices. I’m not saying i don’t know about the sharing feature, it’s just that ⟟ would like to be able to have a way to have one project on one device and be able to edit it and still have the ability to edit on another device"
5,furrys are awesome,"this app is so great, it’s easy to use and understand and most importantly NO WATERMARK 😳 all i have to say is you’re very limited with the animations you can use for text when it comes to the text moving. the text is always in the same spot. what i’m trying to say is add some text animations that..move around? kind of like regular animations, like swing, zoom, rotate, stuff like that but with text? hope this reaches you, if you see this it would be great if you could add some more, thank you"
5,jyggjyghj,"When I got this, I was very impressed with how professional it looked. It’s really good because of the variety of transitions and filters, plus they are all free. It’s really easy to use if you are a beginner and if you like to make fancam, amvs, etc. Also, the ability to extract the audio and the ability to overlay is some thing you wouldn’t normally see for free. My only complaint is how underrated this app is, it needs at least 4.8 stars. I will definitely suggest this app to other people😊"
5,I 💖 🦄,"I have been using this app for a few months now and I still am in love with it. I have been using it to edit all my videos and it even my photos as well. There r sooooo many awesome features u can use such a text, filters, stickers, overlays, and so much more!!! I don’t see any problems with this app and if you r having troubles it is problems just your devise. This app is super easy 2 use and really can make your videos/photos magical."
5,Unknown18930,"So I’ve been editing videos on this app for about a year now and it’s a great editing app. I absolutely love it but, I’ve seen a new update where there is smooth slowmo and its only for version 5.5.0 . I cant update my capcut to get it I think it’s because I’m on iPad but I was wondering when version 5.5.0 is going to release on iPad gen 7 because that’s what I use to edit but other than that it’s a amazing editing app and I really recommend it!"
3,Terovsepyan,One thing I do not like about CapCut is when it tells me I have no storage when I cleaned half of my iPad out with my apps and photos I literally only have 4 apps that are really important to that I can’t delete I can delete my photos but not apps which I literally have only 4 important apps. So now I have No photos and it’s still saying I don’t have any storage and to go make storage. So could you please fix that because every time I edit some videos then save them at least when I make another video it’s saying I have no storage. Will you please Fix that.
5,Try's to hack,"First off, I’d like to thank the creators of this app for making it free to use for everybody. Most apps as good as this do not allow it and make u pay crazy amount of money or buy a subscription for something not even as close to good as this. Second of all, id like to acknowledge how good the effects are. These are some crazy good effects. And lastly, how easy it is to use!! This app is probably the easiest editing app I have ever seen/used and will definitely remain that way. Great job!!!"
5,cloroxbleach29,I have been using capcut for 2 years now and I can say from experience that this is way better than kinemaster forcing you to buy a subscription to remove the water mark but with capcut there is no water mark on the videos I edit plus it’s totally free!!!! So if you are looking for a video editor that is free simple easy to use than capcut is the option for you pal!   Thank you for making my 2 years wonderful capcut :D
5,𝙴𝚛𝚑𝚎𝚛𝚒𝚢𝚊,"I love this app 100% it’s 100% free and a removable watermark! And really good transitions, animations, and really good stickers, and they have pip (picture in picture)! But there always some cons though I really think they should add green screens, more free to use music, more filters like from Colourtone, the ability to import text, more font options, and fix the text box bug, and lastly more sound effects thank you if you are reading this have a good day!"
4,CapCut review,"CapCut isn’t actually that bad. It’s a reliable app I use for my gacha TikTok’s, but the only problem is that I have to crop my photos. I’m not quite sure if there is a “fill in, or fit in” option in the app. If not, I recommend these options since I’m having a really difficult time, I own an apple x. (I’m sorry, I can’t explain things lol) These phones have black those black borders where you can see the time, and battery. But like I said, it’s an amazing app and this is the only problem I’m really having difficulties with, thank U:)❤️"
3,😎SwagPizzaGaming🍕,"So when I downloaded this app, I was having fun. I was enjoying the transition effects and other stuff. I was riding high until today.   I have a big school project with a friend due tomorrow, and I'm afraid I might fail BECAUSE OF THIS APP. This morning, I spent some time in CapCut working in the project. This evening, I opened it. All the progress I made in the morning was GONE. But I thought, no big deal, probably a one time glitch. 45 minutes later, it deleted my progress again! 45 precious minutes TO COMPLETE WASTE!  So yeah. Fix your app please. Before I stop using it."
4,Bella💖💕💞💗💝💘💓,"This app is great and all but some of the effects (specifically the ones in the party section) don’t work the unreal effect, the shake effect etc. and i find it very annoying bc i need the unreal effect for a certain edit but it just won’t work i’ve tried it on both videos and photos i’ve tried it with different effects on top of it i’ve tried it with basically everything even deleting and reinstalling the app didn’t work please fix this it’s really annoying"
5,i will uninstall raid,So I think this is a godly app for a mobile device and I love editing with it trust me the ui is just stunning but i have one small thing I'm hoping you would add. So like if i input a song I'm too lazy to type the words for edits so maybe if possible could you add a option to add lyrics to song automatically because the captions don’t work with the background music lol if you could do that i would die of happiness. Thanks for reading this!
4,Reece Thompson (Pixel),"It would just be amazing of you could add a feature where I could save my own text styles, this would include animations key frames, anything I add to that text would be saved.   The second thing you should add is a feature where if I drag the text for the whole video and add the animation, make it so that when I split the text in half both texts get the animation   Right now when I split the text, the animation has to be reapplied to the second half of the split, and it’s tedious to add every time."
5,hjfjdjdjksks,"This truly is an amazing app, especially for beginners. I’ve tried so many apps and programs because I’ve wanted to learn how to edit since I saw it existed, but CapCut has really introduced me to key aspects of the art form better than anything else. I get so excited to create using this app. As I’ve learned more about editing though I really think the app could benefit from a tiles function outside of the preset animations (maybe in the effects section of the app?)"
4,Arnold jk its just me :),"I tried the app out because my brother recommended it and boyyyy was I impressed. The effects, animation, sounds, etc were exactly what I wanted and I’m obsessed! The problem is, when I started creating videos that were about 15 minutes long, it started getting really glitchy. I lost lots of my work that I worked really hard on. I spend HOURS on end editing and if it keeps glitching on my work, I’m going to have to stop using the app. So please, PLEASE fix this, because I love this app and I don’t want to stop.  Ty!"
5,anya 😌,"Overall its great and easy to use and beginner friendly. And the fact that its free surprises me. But anyways here are some suggestions: 1. Graphs!! I feel like if you add graphs it will be more confusing, but If you make it just a simple graph mechanic it will be simple and easy, although you should make it an options in settings to do advanced and what advanced will mean like to be able to do graphs or not. Graphs will just make edits a lot smoother.   2. Being able to import text fonts! There is a pretty wide variety of fonts, but it would be even better if we could import our own.  3. More transitions!   Anyways thats all. But 5/5 i do recommend this app. Very user friendly. EVERYTHING Free and I hope it stays like that. The fact that it makes editing 100x easier and FREE simply amazes me."
5,PhamFamily,"CapCut is awesome. But what I mean from the title is that:  In the CapCut studio, sometimes the preview seems low-quality, laggy, and unmoveing.     Well, if you export it then in your photos it’s wayyy better! It’s much more high quality and clear then in the studio. It’s 100% free to use and has no watermark- (only at the end but you can crop it.)  it has dozens of filters, effects, and transitions to use, which is SUPER helpful! Also in the home screen there’s a feature called ‘feature overview’ which is like a tutorial but much more short and easy to understand, which helped me a lot.  In conclusion, (I’m sorry if this is like a essay 😂) CapCut is easy to use, high quality, and will definitely not meet your expectations but go above them. (They’re WAY beyond your expectations, they go higher then that.)"
5,ᴢᴀʏ ᴢᴀʏ❤︎︎,I really like cap cut and I do lots of edits there but I tried to do a velocity edit and how I do it is that I g to style and put auto velocity I tried doing that right now but I can find style anymore maybe one way to do a velocity edit is maybe by adding a velocity effect I have lots of other suggestions put out of all I think it would be good to have different types of velocity edits and maybe new fonts that’s all I think cap cut is a really great app!
2,jsjdhehsjhwhr,"Capcut is easy for most people, it is very easy to me but very hard at the same time capcut is so fun but sometimes it gets on my nerves because I have no storage and so far I’ve had to delete the app because I don’t have effects that I need. Like the velocity effect I don’t have it so I have to delete capcut and download it again which is SUPER annoying and not cool I sometimes think that I have to give up on editing but look at others edits and makes me not want yo quit I sometimes think editing is not for even for SOME people, so I far I hate this app but it’s good I guess I’ve I had to rate it I would rate it a 5,I’m giving it 2 stars."
3,Jeweli Hines,"So first I downloaded CAPCUT I had it for a very long time I used it like once every week or whenever I wanted to edit… it started acting up out of no where and the app started shutting off so randomly and then I restarted the app and it would just be a black screen and wouldn’t load in the app. So I deleted CAPCUT and tried to reinstall it after a long time, and it says it’s still loading from when I first pressed to install it.. like it’s not even downloading at all it’s just the circular loading spinning thing! Idk what to do and I really want to edit CAPCUT please help!"
5,Jkuhn2006,"I’m not sure if it’s happening for anyone else but whenever I try to use more than two key frames, it starts moving on its own! Very frustrating, especially as I need to use key frames, because I like to animate danganronpa sprites and makes it impossible! But I couldn’t figure out how to use alight motion lol 😅😅 I love the stickers and how simple the design is, it’s so easy to use and navigate, very easy and good for beginners and pros alike! CapCut, you have my respect."
4,_space_jesus_,"I think it’s great, I’ve used many other apps like After effect, video star, and premier pro but CapCut was the easiest to learn and use. My only complaint is there aren’t great text setting like After Effects has great text features, and that’s something cap cut lacks. Adding velocity would be amazing because that’s like the only reason I pay for video star and if you added that then this app would be on top!! So overall amazing for beginners and great for experienced editors as well,"
4,YoAyce,"I love this app, their are many features, you can put effects on to your clips, and you can also use cool texts and fonts onto your video. But with that, today I found out that if you put a text onto your video, and you add another clip to the project, it will say tap to add text on the screen. Which is very annoying because I wasn’t able to even take it off the screen, it would just stay there. So please fix this capcut!"
4,EliteCFR,"I love this app so so much, I’ve made so many good montages, video edits, and even AMV’s. But recently, I was deleting some old projects to free some storage and I accidentally deleted a project I had been working on for a few weeks. Please, add a recovery system. Preferably ( for simplicity sake ) in Apple style. You delete something, if goes to the garbage but it stays in that “tin” for a week or so unless you clear it immediately. Whilst projects are in the “tin” you can recover them. I and many more would love to see this. Thank you, bye."
4,Alicec1210playsroblox,So I really like editing from this app but it always says couldn’t import even when I delete a few apps it still says that please respond I just wanna make edits it’s nicer then my other ones it’s just that import thing PicsArt or InShot doesn’t do that even peachy so please get rid of that and it never lets me do it and it’s annoying when I join I always have to delete a app I’m not downloading another app so please fix this and everything else is fine sorry this was my feedback but your app is good besides
4,brouno boy,"Ok so I absolutely love CapCut but there is a few suggestions 1. I get that it takes room but it takes so much room on my iPad that I have to delete a lot of apps and edits I worked hard on. 2. It would be a cool idea if you added a thing to help with roblox content (I know it’s not ideal but it would help a handful of users)   But also I love this app I would for sure recommend and it’s super easy to use, completely free, so many cool filters and helps you with tutorials on how to use stuff! ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅso overAll just a few suggestions!"
4,TLJoss,"I give 5 stars but there is bug, when you adjust rotation of key frame, it went wrong than I wanted, I raged few times just now, please fix this bug, thank you! Btw, from shine! Edit: if you read this, please fix this bug once again! Thank you so much. Edit 2: ugh I raged more just now, because of keyframes, I was trying to make cookie run kingdom fan made pull, I was so mad at keyframes so 4 stars now. Btw Thanks. Edit 3: Ugh I give up now though I will hold keyframes until bug will fixed. Btw thanks again!"
2,tiktok follow me cute09887,I do not know what is wrong with the app I have the app TikTok on my phone and I see people talking about how good it is to make edits so I decided to download it to see for myself I decided to download this app two times in a row and when I wanted to make my edit it kept telling me that my storage was full I couldn’t believe it just because I have 15 photos and seven videos in the app Photos and I barely have any apps on my phone so I didn’t understand why it kept telling me that my storage is full I  do not know if the problem is the app or my phone but I just do not understand why it keeps telling me my storage is full when it’s not
5,peee peeee pooopoooo mannn,"i absolutely love that this app is completely free and has no watermark!!! and is awesome quality, BUT, i would like it if you added some of the features that video star has. Like layers and a overlay option, and an option to were you place and arrow on where u want to move ur person/ object places and a feature to where u can add shapes and make the turns and edits more smooth and so it doesn’t look blocky and chunky, other than that the app is literally perfect"
5,OldTownRoad2019,This app is perfect for all your editing needs. I have been using it 24/7 because its so easy to edit with. If you like editing I recommend this app. I told my friend about this app and she was so surprised that this app is so good. She has been trying to find editing apps for her videos so I recommend this one her. She said this is that app that she would like to use from now on. I am so happy with all my videos so far. Thank you CapCut for this amazing experience with your app
5,Caxitlyn 🤪,"This app is great. Most to everything is free, no ads, and you can literally crop out the watermark. I have a few suggestions though.. Firstly, maybe some new transitions? I would totally be willing to pay a bit of cash for some new transitions. And Secondly, key frames? Sort of odd, but it would def help out while editing. I don’t have any more that comes to mind, but this app is awesome. You should download it! Super easy to use compared to VS. (no hate to them I just am very confused haha 😅)"
5,CottonKity,And I don't know what I don't know what I don't know how are the same thing that I was like a little bit more and the same time to get it is the best for a good night I love u know I love u know I love me a little more of the same time to get to be a little bit more than you know I was like I love me to get to get to be able to the I I was like I love me and the same I i in a i ii lol I don't know what I don't know what I don't know what I don't know
4,toasty_real,Okay so I love this app I can edit my videos really nicely and I love the transitions and effects it’s all really cool! But there’s something that really annoys me 😅 so when you put in your pictures then you import your audio when you go to put another picture in it always says that you have no photos.. so I have to refresh the app and load it again :P i need this to be fixed like ASAP because I will die or something because it’s really annoying having to refresh the app again- 😭😭😭
4,Rayxioum,"I have been using CapCut for about 2 1/2 years and.. let’s just say it isn’t the best editing app out there. Yes, I know it’s a free editing app, but come on, there’s tons of free editing apps that are above average. Capcut has minor issues, but the one that annoys me the most is when ever I import a project, it makes my edit(s) offbeat, low-qualited, and choppy. I never experience these issues in-app whilst editing, but always when imported. I love this app so much and it has SO much potential (besides the constant bugs/glitches)."
5,Sadie_Reviews,"Capcut is very helpful when editing. Prior to downloading Capcut, I had iMovie. I am pleasantly surprised on how much better Capcut is than iMovie. This is not at all saying iMovie is bad, its just not amazing when youre editing. Comparing the two, Capcut has stickers, text, transitions, and more. Imovie has text and transitions. In Capcut you can move around the text, in iMovie you can not. In Capcut their are stickers, in iMovie their arent. I hope this what helpful, please remember Capcut has filters from TikTok and is 100% free."
5,Gacha CourtxX,"(I’m using iPad Pro if it matters)Ok so I’m not gonna into details about how amazing this app is, but it truly is but every day I use this app and when I go in the app, there is this bug makes it flip horizontal (I mostly have it vertically) and sometimes I have screen lock on but it does that even without screen lock but the way I fix this going out of the app and going back in. It’s just kinda annoying just to get back out and in."
5,SisBroMomDad,First of I love this app I have made so many videos it’s so easy to use. Many great filters and effects! And best of all it’s free but I like to say on thing for the audio I would love an recording option because I use SoundCloud for my music it and I would love to just record music and put it in with out extracting audio from a video cause that never ever loads. Other than that Amazing app and love to see more from you guys! Keep up the great work!
5,MXR1SA08,"Ok so when i got capcut, i struggled for a couple minutes. But that was it, Capcut is such an easy app to edit it on!! And I recommend it to beginners, or even if you not a beginner!! I’ve made such good edits with it! The only thing i have to complain about is after i made some edits it said my storage was full and i had to delete some of my edits to make more. Could you pls fix that?? But other then that its a really great app!! Well whoevers reading this have a good day/night!!!"
5,f 7t8 g7t f7ti,"This app is AMAZING! Unlike other apps, you don’t need a subscription or anything else! I have been on it for a while and the edits turned out really great! This is just a tip so you don’t have to read the next part...  If you want your video to move a lot, press animation, choose [in,out,combo] once that is set, upload your video and add another animation of your choice. Keep following those two steps until you are happy with the result.  Thank you so much producer!!"
5,layla joslyn,"I really like that everything’s free and you have a choice of watermark. I also really love that you can make it super fast. The thing I feel like needs some work is when I try to upload a certain sound to use it takes forever to load and when I try to restart it, that does nothing. The thing that bugs me is that it works for some sounds and not for others. Otherwise it is absolutely perfect and amazing"
3,Alxvndruh97,"Ok at first I loved this app it has awesome effects and such, but I want to maybe suggest some things to add and talk about somethings to fix.  It would be cool if we could have a bigger music library because most of the sounds are basic and arent really that great. And also maybe allow longer video times other than just 15min limit ?? That would be awesome and lastly the app has been pretty sluggish not sure if there is a bug but it would be nice if editing would be smoother, i know these things take time but just thought i’d mention them! Thank you :)"
3,Kskskslwls,Cap cut is a good place to edit you can do text to speech and doing cool edits and videos and more but the problem is i made 3 cap cut videos and one was for my yt channel its how to make a root beer float thing then i was gonna make a edit it was good going fine but then i was gonna make another video and it said not enough memory please try deleting drafts or phone storage i deleted all my drafts except for the one i was making and deleted some apps and some photos and it still didnt work please fix this if this was not a problem it would be. A 5 stars
5,Katie 🌴,"this app is AMAZING for editing videos and adding audios. it is way easier than any other video editing app/program and it’s free to use for all features! there is no watermark and a variety of tools. there is no need to switch app to app to edit anything, it’s all here. i use this app to make edits for tiktok mostly, but you can use it for anything. the app is not the best for voice/music editing though. highly recommend getting this app!!"
2,chickenwinghshhssh,"I’m not sure if this review will be seen or not. But I’ve been suing capcut for a while now. And I will say the app is really good. The quality is high and the no logo thing is pog. But one of the only problems I have with capcut is it’s transitions. We have a large variety of transitions to choose from of course, but as a serous editor who is broke, I think cooler transitions would be awesome! The transitions we have now get old and boring, snd sometimes they don’t even connect. We need transitions that are smooth and fresh.   Another suggestion I have is... please give us more effects!!! Every update when we get more effects I’m honestly disappointed. I think it will be something cool but it’s never enough. We should have more coloring and glow effects. That would be perfect.  Also, can you please add an “effect intensity” feature? So we can control the opacity of an effect or something?  More shakes would be cool too.  That’s all for now! But if you see this than ty!"
4,derick sanabia,"You’re probably asking “Why 4 stars only?” Well first of all the app was working fine for me for 7 months. But today I tried to make a mash up and then it said “CapCut requires access to the album for editing and saving videos.” And I was really confused because the app already had access to my saved videos. So I had to delete the whole app with 3,654 templates. And when I downloaded the app again it said the same thing! And that’s the ONLY reason I made this review so CapCut, please fix this 😒"
4,♡e͜͡l͜͡l͜͡y͜͡s͜͡e͜͡♡,I do recommend this app it’s really fun and easy to make videos. Although here are some things I want to change and to make it better there should be no limit on overlays I was trying to make a vid for YT but it just didn’t work because there is a limit on how much overlays you use SO PLEASE FIX THAT!!!!!!!!!😖 also this app takes up a lot of space and so maybe you can change that I would rate this a 5 star but if things weren’t a problem it would be perfect 👍 👌😁🤩😍
4,Someoneumightknow,"This app is great. I used to use iMovie but then I saw This. This is the best mobile video making app in my opinion. But there’s one thing that needs to change. I can’t copy the video I made, and put it on my google drive, or put it in my camera roll. Would you please add that. I want to be able to put it in a folder. And also, there needs to be a share button. I want to be able to share my beautiful creation. But I can’t. Please add these things, it’ll make things a lot easier"
5,Garlicbread/slice,"I have used this app before for my videos which CapCut helps a lot.  I also like that I can go to the sound option and choose some sounds that I have favorited on Tik tok.  But the problem is I only got to use it once and now I get an error saying I must connect to the internet when I am.  I would this error to be fix when you have the time, no rush.  Other than that though this app is good for beginners like me"
5,Carolineamelia8,"This app has really helped me with my edits. It is such an easy way to add sounds,music, overlay, effects and more! All of the other apps I have tried are so confusing or you have to pay to use almost any of the filters. With CapCut I have never seen an add or any in app purchase option. I make Roblox edits to be specific. So if you are looking for an easy, no purchase editing app, CapCut is for you! If I could rate this 1,000,000 stars I absolutely would, thank you CapCut!"
5,cute_0,Omg 😱 this is the app that I was looking for it has all the features and you don’t have to PAY FOR ANYTHING the biggest thing I like about this app is that you can REVOME BACKGROUND and add greenscreen in it simply amazing HOPE THIS APP DOSENT DISAPPOINT OR DISAPPEAR because if it does I am going to be very sad 😢 I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP especially if your making gacha videos or you want to add green screen in any background that you have and have a hard time finding or you’re being frustrated
5,Donny Tran,"CapCut made me feel like an editor, so far better to understand easier more then any other apps, these features I would like to see are More Transitions, and Cutsom Transitions, Custom Transitions in such as making you own very transitions, also if you do add this please make a separate tab for this because I want my customs transitions to be saved so I can use it next time. Thanks CapCut for making me feel good as an editor! 🎉🎊"
4,PinkPrinces7,"So Literally Like 5 Minutes Ago CapCut just restarted when I pressed the app and now all of my edits and progress is gone and I’m very just at loss of words cause like.. I was very proud of my edits and I didn’t save them to my phone cause I don’t have ANY storage on my phone but besides that, the app is great and has a lot of good transitions and a LOT of fonts and colors! And I would 100% recommend CapCut it’s literally like the best editing app in my opinion coming from an editor this my favorite editing app I’ve ever used!🤍✨"
4,Catgirl. 12345,This is amazing but it could use a few things. Since my favorite animations are far from where the none place is already selected it would be nice to have a “frequently used” tab or “favorites” tab. Templates would also be a good thing but if you could add those two things the app would be perfect. And if your making a video not editing one it would be good too get rid of some of the lag but since this app is mostly for editing it’s ok for the last one to not be there
5,nugget turtle Ocean bean,"Alright, I LOVE this app. But I have one request. You don’t have to, but I think it would be rlly cool!! Make accounts! I’m getting a new phone soon and I don’t wanna lose my edits. I’m rlly proud of them, and I want them to stay in the app. Now I know you can just save them. But I really want them to stay in CapCut, and I don’t wanna lose them in the app. But if y’all think it would ruin the app, it’s fine!! I just think it would be a really nice update.  Thanks for creating an amazing app!! <33"
5,lily ana vega Rodriguez,Okay so when I first got cap cut I was so exited because it was everywhere I made a lot of my best videos with this and really helps I really like how there was a tutorial on everything and everything is easy! But one suggestion can you put music on videos like blinding lights by the weekend or bad guy bye Billie ellish just like real music if not I understand otherwise everything is perfect I recommend for beginner editors is great for edits as well 5/5
5,IRONnetflx,I’ve been using CapCut for about 5 months now AND ITS AMAZING it’s so easy to use and figure out it’s perfect for tiktok vids or other apps like Instagram I’m not sure I would recommend doing animations though I feel like that would be really hard. The animations for the pictures work great it’s overall a really good app. The one annoying part is that I have to clear up the cache all the time. But I do recommend to use this app. Sorry if my punctuation is off.
4,MaddyAddy🦧,CapCut is an amazing editing app! It’s very high quality and pretty easy to work with! It’s probably my favorite editing app! Although it’s wonderful there is one small problem.. With the latest update (2.3.1) the icons at the bottom are more or less frozen. When I try tapping on them it does not work. I’m wondering if it’s a problem with my storage or something on my end or if it’s something on your end. I’m also wondering if it’s happening to anyone else. Please look into that! Thank you!
5,hsjsnxudnhs,"So I have been using capcut for awhile now to make edits for anime characters and stuff. Let me just tell you this: it is literally sooo good! The fact that it has no watermark and all features are free is just awesome! The only thing that I would suggest adding is graphs so we can make our own transitions (don’t get me wrong, yalls premise transitions are beautiful!) and let us use keyframes for things like adjusting the exposure or saturation. Besides that, the app is literally flawless!"
5,mollieshy,"I got this app to made edits and it work out (PERFECT) for me! I have been looking for a app that has animations, and let you record your sound and have it in the video as a sound plus more! I gave this app a 5 star because it deserves it, and I would highly recommend this app! But.. there’s just one thing when I crop the video it kinda lags out but, they will probably fix that very soon but over all this app is (AMAZING)! I will use this app forever! 😌✨"
4,Capcut user2,"I found CapCut a few months ago, and I think it’s a great editing app. I’m a beginner editor, and this app has definitely helped me improve a little bit. Although, I’m having problems with the audio/sound. It’s not showing all of the audios that I’ve favorited on tiktok, and I’m a bit frustrated with this because I was going to use some of those audios for edits. If there is anything you could do to fix this, please do. Everything else works perfectly, though."
5,jungminyun12,"i love capcut! it has some of the best features i have ever seen in an editing app! i  just have a few minor suggestions.  1. maybe make it so that animations can go both ways, if you understand. sometimes i have an animation with a spin that goes left, but the smooth spin animation (spin) only starts out on the right. maybe you could make it so that animations could have multiple ways to go  2. more text animations. here’s the thing- text animations don’t have a wide range of things to do. maybe you could add some of the combo picture/video animations to the text one, because i would really like smoother in/out ones. also maybe make it so you could also add combo animations to text while in and out animations are present  thanks! hope you read this :D"
5,Aydilla,At first I was skeptical with this app just thinking it was another video editing app but long story short I’ve been getting into more video editing (I’m a rookie) but wow let me tell you this app is by far the best app I’ve downloaded!! None of that try a free trial everything is perfect unlimited editing and simple editing steps I’m still getting the hang of editing my videos more but wow this app does wonders let me tell you that !! Please never stop making this app lol
4,🚱⁉️🚳⭕️🚸⭕️❌💤✅,"Honestly, CapCut is great and super easy to use once you get the hang of it. It’s very organized and everything makes sense unlike other editing apps. Great if you are just starting to edit. Some that that annoys me a LOT is that when you go to slow a clip down, the slowed clip just turns really glitchy and it makes whatever you are editing look bad. I really can’t think of anything else. If you are a beginner editor, I definitely recommend it."
4,cinabunnyl,"I really love this app I use it for every video edit, because of the awesome effects and great features. There is also no watermark as well and is amazing to use. One thing I wanted to suggest is the voice over. I have to hold the microphone button down in order to record my voice, which is annoying because I want a button to just press and record I don’t want to hold it down because I’m doing stuff while recording. Overall good app just hope they can add that."
5,xxkaydenbayden909000,"Hi! If you’re looking at my review to see if this app is good to download, I recommend to download, this app is way better than KineMaster, video star, etc. This app is free for everything! I’m very happy with this app, but I have a suggestion: Please add more video effects. If you add more video effects this app is a 10/10 app for editors like me. Thank you for reading, I recommend downloading this app as you have the ability to remove watermark, etc."
5,🔮💜🦄,Ok so you might think of capcut as a boring starter app but after you get some practice ITS SO GOOOOOD FOR FREE? I make roblox dancing edits and they usually turn out so good. But the reason I’m making this comment is because I have a suggestion..  can you please make folders like you can hold one of ur edits and hold it on another and it makes a folder that you can add more videos for! I really want to put my favorite and unfinished edits somewhere because it’s really messy right now. But that’s it so byeeee
4,MoonFox_07,"This app is amazing! But the only problem is that when I try to make new videos, it says, “Insufficient storage.” I always end up offloading some apps with storage and kinda deleted a few photos. There are no other apps that I don’t need because I need all of them. I actually do. And whenever I reinstall an offloaded app, it would sometimes say, “Unable to install.” So I would really appreciate it if you can do something about that. But, overall, it’s a great app."
5,Donut Crumble,"I don’t normally review apps but this is by far the best editing app ever, there are some things I can suggest though and this one is very important. Please add a make your own color option for overlays in stock photos. It will really help! Overall there aren’t many bugs and the app is really good at edits. One bug that MUST be fixed though is the stickers, the stars exploding an things like that get cut off in a box which makes it look very weird"
3,joclynn m,"i love this app, its a very nice editing app for beginners, but. i tried to make a edit today, and i took time picking photos out, and i got very upset because it took awhile to pick out these photos, and it said it couldn't import. I checked my wifi several times, and i knew there was nothing wrong with my wifi, even though it said it was because of my wifi, it also happened for my friend, where it said the photos couldn't import and said poor connection. Please fix this issue. I know this is not just me."
2,remikookie,"This app is really nice when it comes to editing, especially if you’re new to all of it. I spent 4-5 DAYS on a project, got it close to being done, and then I accidentally deleted it while trying to delete another video I didn’t need. The whole project, GONE. There is no way for me to recover it, no way to fix it, nothing. I had so much in that project, and now it’s gone since there is no way to recover deleted projects.   There’s many others who are having this problem, why can’t you guys give us the recover video option? I’m so upset now, and about to toss this app in the trash."
4,hehehhxhenxu,I just wanted to say that it’s very annoying and disappointing that you cannot undo the careless mistake of deleting an edit. I ask that you at least wait a week to officially delete it forever and have trash icon tab with the edit being able to be recovered. I spent a lot of time on and edit and made this mistake with not much in mind because most editing apps have this feature. I really hope you get back and are able to help me recover it. Please I really loved this edit.
5,Wings._.chicken,"Do not get me wrong but CapCut is my most used app for my edits! It’s a really good app and it is amazing for beginners but there is a bug that I’ve had. Whenever I try to remove background of an overlay, the other overlay stays with the same form as the first one. This is very annoying and I would suggest you guys please fix this bug. Although this is a really good app and I think that you guys are amazing!"
4,Vanessa___77652,"I love this app, I use it all the time to make edits and I have been using it for 4 years. Great to make animations. But if it had an easier turn, to turn and move things. I would be more happy. And for some reason, it became very glitchy, and started to move things by itself when I was trying to move it. Like, when I would move it one way, it would move the other way, it’s almost like another person is trying to move it. But overall, it’s a good app. 👍"
5,Videoaudio2,"If you would like a free app that grants you access to so many resources, then this is the one for you. I have been using app for about 2 years now and it is by far the best free mobile editing app. I love all the abundant features that always seem to get bigger with every update. This app is extremely user friendly unlike other editing apps. So if you want to make great videos, then you found your app. 😍😁☺️"
1,Opal----,I have used this app for a long time to make edits. But all of a sudden it said I couldn’t edit stuff because it didn’t have access to photos. So I went to where I usually allow apps to access photos and the camera or whatever but it wasn’t there. All it had that I could allow access too was Siri and cellular data. I tried to look to see what else could be the problem but I couldn’t find anything else wrong. I haven’t been able to use the app. Then I knew it would probably delete my edits but I didn’t care anymore and deleted the app and redownloaded it. Now I just have CapCut and can’t do anything on it.
4,user127272718,"I love capcut! It’s really easy to use once you get the hang of it and I’ve been able to make high quality videos, but I have on suggestion/complaint. When I use the overlays and add keyframes  I find it really difficult to rotate the overlay, so maybe you could fix this somehow because when I rotate the overlay it gets bigger and goes all over the place. Maybe I just haven’t figured the right technique out, but it sometimes gets really frustrating."
4,✨Human✨,"I love this editing app so much, but there’s some issues I have a limit on how much videos I have saved and that’s a little problem. I have right now one video saved and says I have no more storage and memory, and don’t know how to fix that. I deleted all my saved videos and it’s still not working, I was wondering if y’all could fix that or if it is they’ll me how to fix it. This app is a very good app totally free no watermark or anything, it just needs some fixes."
5,Queendee34,So I just wanted to say don’t change like other creators for example video leap used to be free in all kind of way since I don’t have any star for example I would use it instead of Video Star because I could do overlays and stuff and now since the app blew up they want to make everything cost money that’s why I deleted it and give it zero stars that why I love CapCut they don’t change when they get famous
1,wolfgirl/catgirl yeet,First of all the app glitches and it won’t let you put your audio on the thing the app tracks your storage so when it says storage full up you got a upgrade your storage because the app and you can’t even make anything because that and it’s terrible it’s not even that high quality like video start or any other editing apps and The updates are terrible and in general the app is just just not as high-quality as video star and other high-quality editing apps so to wrap all this up since this is a short little message to capcut this is one of the worst editing apps I’ve been on a long time don’t waste my time anymore
5,Adi is epic,"I recently got this app after my friend recommended it to me, and it personally works great for me! It’s really easy to get the hang of, and simple enough to understand the basic functions without a tutorial. Sometimes if I’m sending it, it might lag a little, but other than that it’s perfect! It’s easy to use, as well! I never took the tutorial, but it was relatively simple to figure out. It’s a very helpful app and I really enjoy using it!"
1,bob joe 19,"I loved this app compared to many other editing apps. It’s all free, and there’s no cheap deals as many other editing apps like to add subscription and premium fees for us mobile editors. Recently I have been working on an edit, and as I put in my clip from camera roll, I notice when my clip finishes it freezes until the second clip I put in is almost finished, making it look laggy. I’ve tried changing clips, rearranging, and even deleting a project to get rid of this problem, but nothing is working. There’s no update for the app right now and it seems like I’ll have to call the edit off. Very unfortunate and I sincerely hope this can get fixed."
5,HM.xx,"this app is REALLLY good all the features, transitions EVERYTHING are good. I love to edit on this app, and as i start adding transitions or even split and make a video shorter it starts to lag and the audio glitches and it gets very frustrating. For example video star, i could do anything on there and it wouldn’t get laggy or glitch at all. I would love to expect that from this app too!! Other than that this app is good and more people should try it out."
5,sal pls,"I love this app to use the bottom of my heart and I will say why first, it’s free and there’s little to no adds. It has loads of effects including things like superhero effects to camera lens to shadows. You can over lay videos and and there’s a great selection of stock videos. So to the creator of this app: great job. But my only request is that you add a green screen setting. This way you could well, use a green screen in your videos. Thanks"
5,GOODIEO GOOD,So I always use this app and it’s a perfect app no ads no monthly fee but the only problem is sometimes it’s hanging like today it hang when I tap one of draft project beacuse I did not finished it and it did not work so please help me it’s beacuse of the new update and can you please add more animation beacuse I love your animation and the transitions thank you hope you fix some things but after all it’s my favorite editing app
5,Jevans121,The app is awesome but sometimes when I add a certain effect is freezes the edit. I also think you should be able to see other people’s edits but make a option to make them public or private I would also like it if you could make a it to were you can look up a song and put it as the audio. Your app is great I use it so much and I make some really good edit
3,Liana T,"I started using this instead of another app a few months ago. It has some great effects, text options, filters, etc. but the lag when making an edit is starting to get to me. The clips always lag behind when I’m close to finishing an edit and it makes it hard to judge whether or not the clips match up with the audio or not. There’s other people that are having this problem as well and if this doesn’t get fixed I am switching to another app."
5,AJSJSJZNKSOWODNDHS,This is a really great app for beginners. The affects are really good and amazing. All I would like tho is that maybe capcut could add better velocity and more grand and cool animation although the animation is already good I would love to see more cool thing u can add in edits. Another thing: the chroma key works well sometimes but I still see that bg. So maybe if capcut could fix that a hit it would be awesome. Overall this app is amazing and wonderful! I recommend getting this app.
5,jahfhwjfjx,CapCut is good thing to edit videos with and I make Gacha and random edit also I love were you can import sound from videos. And the sound it comes with are pretty good. They add more when the updates happen. I got a while ago on my old phone. I got a new phone bc I dropped mine in the toilet. Also the is a thing that you can add or not is the songs on the radio and your phone instead the music on the app now
5,y2kshumon,"I live Capcut you can discover new things . It’s so easy and is NOT confusing , the first day I started using Capcut just in a snap I understood everything! I’m never gonna stop using cap cut. Unlike some other editing apps Capcut is the easiest (TO ME) I recommend to use Capcut for editing! But like when you add an animation to the text sometimes it changes the letter of a word you typed. Idk if this is a prob of mine or anyone eles. But I highly recommend Capcut!"
4,gggodiscoll,"This app is amazing it lets me do things that other editing apps can’t like key frames, and lighting and more,but there is a problem. See when I save the video to my photos and play it back to me, the animation is out of sync to the audio or beat. I thought it was my phone but i tried everything and it still would be out of sync, so if this is your app that is doing it I would appreciate it if you could fix it but besides that it’s a really good app."
4,Najib Mehri,I’ve downloaded this app yesterday and tried to use it today but when I was working with the app I realized that it’s showing a false error. The app was saying that you’re not connected to internet but I was connected so I thought maybe my internet it’s not working I changed to sim card data but still the same thing. I hope you read this and fix the problem.   Since I can see no one is reading and fixing then I don’t care bruh🤢🤢🤮
5,bubblesthe hronny,"Normally I wouldn’t write reviews for apps like these but I need to talk about the app. First of all I wanted to say that it’s free! And it works just as nicely as your average editing app. It’s also very easy to upload your photos, videos and audio. Plus you can remove the ending (which basically the watermark) for free. The transitions are very easy to put in to. So let’s just say CapCut is your average editing app but like I said for free."
4,Awsome cat😜,I love this app so much. It is so much fun to use. But the only problem is is that it keeps saying my storage is full. I deleted 200 photos and 19 videos and it still says I need to free up more space for a 22 second video. Please fix this. I really think this is a good app for editing. I was trying to make something for my friend but I can’t because apparently my storage is full. Idk if it’s just me or not but please if you can fix this I really don’t want to loose hours of work.
5,amazing gacha lover,"I have been editing on this app for months now I would like to say it’s amazing. It’s amazing for beginners too. CapCut gives updates once in a while, not too long. I have improved so much since I started editing and I will not be leaving CapCut any sooner at the current moment. Simply if you tired of using the same old things on it then try and make your own stuff on the app. It’s make of creativity."
3,Audrey...,"I love the app and it makes editing super easy but for whatever reason, every time I use the app now when I try to use a sound it says “internet not connected”. I’ve tried everything: restarting internet, disconnecting and reconnecting and the only thing that works is deleting and reinstalling the app. This technique works for editing ONE video and as soon as it’s done, back to no internet connection. Haven’t been able to find a fix online and it’s such a pain to have to continuously reinstall."
5,MS 4458790,"Over all this app is great. I have only one problem. I feel as if there should be more voice effects. Like maybe they could make you sound Australian or Russian. I think it would be cool to have voice effects like that. But like it would sound realistic. So creators of CapCut, if you could add these voice effects this app would be PERFECT for me. ( not that it isn’t already awesome cause it is ) So please add these effects. Thanks!!!!"
2,skksdnkqsmamakbakakakakkaa,"Its a really amazing app, its really cool and stuff . but i think y’all should add better keyframes, graphs , and let us make our own transitions . i really enjoy editing on CapCut, but i’m tired of using the same transitions , and when i mix the transitions it doesn’t even look right . it should also let us save our data, because i had a very cool Shikamaru Nara edit , that i really liked. and capcut was deleted off my phone & when i redownloaded it i was mad that i didn’t have my edit . + capcut editors get bullied alot for using capcut . that’s another reason why y’all should add the things i said . please do:)."
5,mookerson (IM A GURL),I absolutely love this app because it’s FREE!! The only thing I would like to recommend is be able to name the audios that we import from our phone so we don’t lose track to which is which. Please take this into consideration and I would like to thank you for making an editing app that is 100% free ❤️! Edit: I wish I could log in so no process would be lost if anything was to happen to my electronic :((
5,BTS ARMY 111221,"When I started making edits, I would download a bunch of editing apps but the annoying part of it was that I had to pay to either use an effect or filter. When I found CapCut- it was amazing. There were more filters/effects/transitions than all the editing apps I had before combined. Plus with CapCut, you don’t have to pay for anything that you want to use. I’m still new to CapCut but overall I really love it. :)"
4,warriorcatsfan09,"I absolutely love this app and you can make many amazing things with it i just have one problem that happens recently, the style button *3d cube* is just gone it literally disappeared so I can’t make a velocity edit anymore and I’m not the only one having this problem other people have been posting about it recently so now I can’t make my edit which makes me pretty mad I hope this gets fixed very soon but other than that LITERALLY AN AMAZING APP I LOVE IT SO MUCH CHEFS KISS MWAH"
5,baddie547,I have been using CapCut for the the longest because it’s such a great app! No watermark the editing skills are great and everything! but the only problem is that recently every time I hit split and then I want to add a cool effect on it the effect doesn’t work like I try to set the duration but it’s not working I’m about to delete CapCut and then download it again but other than that it’s a great app definitely recommend!
5,LilMexico_.1,Hey capcut I’ve been using your app for a while been making edit videos and stuff love the app honestly but anyways all of sudden yesterday it’s not letting me use no effects or different text and other things and it’s saying I have no internet connection when I Ik clearly connect can you please help me out cuz I tried offloading the app didn’t work and I even went to deleting it erasing all my stuff still didn’t work please help
5,Mia Edullantes,"This app is amazing for editing videos , and cutting down videos ! I honestly think it’s great except for when things are unavailable according to different things that I do, such as the shortcut, when I click something it might say unavailable but other than that I love this app! 10/10 you should definitely download if your interested in editing videos or even making them!"
4,ancnffjntnfmv,So I’ve been using CapCut for a couple years and I decided I wanted to make TikTok videos so I favorite some songs and it didn’t let me use them either said that there is no Internet or that I have no favorite songs or that there just an error so I was just wondering if you could fix this? Because I’ve been having some trouble making my videos recently so I was just wondering if you could see what was happening with that.
3,ALOHA_<33,So I love CapCut but you’re starting to be this issue where if I try to import a picture it won’t let me so I’ve always been checking my Internet whenever it doesn’t let me and my internets completely fine so if you can fix that or maybe just tell me if it’s my Internet and there’s something wrong with it please do because I really wanted to be fixed so I can continue making edits because it’s very hard to make edits when you can’t import the pictures because I like making funny edits
4,Aaji sbbas,At first I didn't know how to edit with this app but later on I became a pro but then after a while for some reason when I opened the app and tried to make a new project it said that I need enough storage. Then I cleared so much stuff off my device and when I opened it again it still says I need storage even though I cleared so much stuff. I even deleted more then 200 photos but it still says I need storage 😑. Should I just delete the whole app? So I rate this 4 stars.
3,lillylillyash,"This is a great video making app better than kine master BUT and this is big it has so much bugs 1. When you make clips to short it freezes to another photo that is close or something like that, as a gacha video maker I get annoyed wit this.. 2. Whenever I need to try and edit the photo or clip it won’t let me it will get me to the animation into another photo or clip! Even when it’s not to short! 3. It dosent show a photo or video even when I got enough storage! Honestly this app pretty much annoys me."
5,soph<33,"I honestly love capcut, it’s free u can create a lot of stuff, when I first started it was pretty hard I’m not gonna lie, but I started getting used to using it, I mean when u start editing u get used to it and it’s really easy a lot of effects and flash and text and more I think this app is really cool vsp is nice to but the thing is I hate how u have to but some effects and other stuff but otherwise it’s pretty I guess but I perfer capcut but I still like vsp ."
5,_videoeditingpro,This app is amazing I am an editor in tiktok I have many followers but my only problem is the quality it is blurry but besides that it is amazing it have great transitions and the effects are great I recommend it and my tiktok is : bloody_h3ll so come check it out if you don’t believe me. also everything is great no subscription or anything unlike video star so if your a beginner editor I recommend this anyways bye!!!!!!!
4,MarrepLatias3,"Capcut was a good app. Today I wanted to make a video with green screen. Since the green screen moved I had to use keyframes. Unfortunately whenever I’d use the keyframes, sometimes it would be hard to scale or move the images. And then when I would review the animation I made from the keyframes. The photo would end up in a totally different place. Please fix this bug, if it is a bug.  Nevermind, disregard what I had said, I found a different way to animate it. Thanks and sorry!"
3,coreydagostino,"When i went to college I didn’t bring my pc and sought out a way to edit on my phone. This app is the closest thing you will get to Adobe After Effects on a phone. I absolutely fell in love with it and it allows me to edit my videos simply,smoothly and fast the only down side about this app is they have taken features like apply to all on resize and made it so you must watch an add before using it. It was not always like this and has become The main contributor to me looking for other editing options."
5,greatiguess-,"The app is great because it has more things for editing and u can make ur edits beautiful!   Edit: these here is a feature I would like capcut to add   When ur doing the tweeting on the things ur doing u can make mistakes by making it big or turned the wrong way, please add a bullet point so u can turn it perfectly, and make it have the same exact big-small box like flipaclip when using the rope"
4,uglycancelbruh,"I’m a beginner at editing and let me tell you, this app was really great! I’m really glad that the transition thingys are free, and not cost like 99$ lol. There is one problem though. It’s quite hard to explain it though, so i’ll do an example. Like, maybe you’re almost finished with an edit but you just need one more photo. But suddenly, it says that there’s no pictures i’m able to put in my edit. Fix it if you want, idc but this app is really good! Would recommend to beginners"
5,get this instent,This app is great but I have some thoughts. One I would love if you could make a green mask transition for us. Also I would like more bling effects. Plus the retro style is amazing i it would be great if you could add more. And the stickers. I don’t use much of them BC I don’t really like them. Like it could be cute to use a little cactus or something else. Oh and extracted sounds is probably the best idea I’ve ever seen.
5,Kiti707,"Constant updates +  features are provided for free. The numerous effects/stickers are one of the best features in this app as well. Never had an issue with crashes or saving either.  For simple stuff, this app works fine alone. For a more serious project, you can use a combo of free mobile video editors and still get the job done. It might not satisfy you in the future but if the devs keep updating, I’m keen to see what’s added next."
5,XoXo9😘😘😘,"When I first looked at the reviews made by other people I thought maybe I shouldn’t download CapCut, but I decided to give it a try. I have a school project that I have to do, which requires taking a video. One of my classmates suggested this app for editing videos.  When I looked at the app & made one video I started to 💗it! So for those of u who think maybe u shouldn’t download it, give it a try & maybe you’ll like CapCut as much as I do."
4,anood2000fan,Ok so ima a person who likes to edit alot and makes some anime edits but I need the velocity option like on style but I can't find the style button - I had it on a video but it's gone now- idk if you add it if there's a new feature to it or it's a big or it just does that idk- but I really really want that style button back plzzzzz also the app is very easy to use and it's good for editing and edits 👍^^ just plz answer my question ☠️😭
4,<mei>,CapCut is a good app and I love it! But please fix this problem I’m having when I use the speed option where there’s a slider to what speed you want when I want the speed to be 3.0x it automatically changes to a different speed for example 1.0x and when I try to change it back it just goes back to 1.0x please fix this i have deleted and reinstalled the app many times but it doesn’t change please fix this problem
5,DJHHUSNHISJISMIJS,"I first heard about CapCut when the 3d Zoom effect or whatever was popular on TikTok, and I wanted to try it for myself and it was pretty cool. I then checked out all the other stuff you could do on it, now I love using the App to edit all the videos I make. (I make Football Edits)   Thank You to whoever made this 🙏  Another thing that makes it great, is that it’s free and has amazing things you can use on your videos."
5,Trick Talbot,"I love this app it is Amazing 🤩 I have some ideas and suggestions for you 1. Recording in the app, I think you should be able to record in the app and use filters on you while you are recording 2. Drawing and erasing parts of the video 3. Creating your own template 4. Photo editing in the app. You guys do an amazing 🤩 job and I love this app because it is easy, quick, fun, and Free Thanks for making this Amazing 😻 app"
5,Xx_Lola_Xx,"This app is amazing! My sister showed it to me, I don’t really like change to much but this app is worth it! I’ve tried countless of other apps and none of them are as good as CapCut!   Reason to download: Completely free, a watermark is optional, great quality, very easy to use, and it’s just overall great!  At times it will bug but it is very rare that it will mess up, which is honestly so nice! And CapCut is even good for beginners because it is very easy to use! Yes, it may be hard to learn at first but everything is! From my experience CapCut is one of the simplest editing apps to use it’s great for all types of editing!   I hope you consider at least trying out CapCut and if you don’t get it try and watch a tutorial somewhere it is definitely worth it!  ~Anonymous"
1,Echorent,"If I was to give this reviews a few days ago, I would’ve given it a 5/5. This app is everything I looked for in an editing program. But that was the past.  Accidentally deleted an edit I was making because the way CapCut sorts your edits based on most recently opened, and not tweaked with. So, when checking to see which one needed to be deleted to “mAke MOrE rOOm” (another problem this app has), I unintentionally got rid of something I was making.   There is no recently deleted folder within the app, and I reached out to support more than a week ago, and have gotten no response. Not even a yes or no. Just flat out ignoring my email."
5,sassandsarcasam,"This is by far the best editing app I have ever used, it barely has any ads so much transitions and it's overall amazing! you should really download, as it is very easy to get a hold of the controls and l to understand them. It only took me a few minutes, and the longer you use and explore it, you can find such cool features and make great edits! It it also doesn't leave a watermark and there's no subscription."
5,laylamayg,For me personally i love capcut for my roblox editing videos. There is only one thing i would enjoy if they added. I really think you should add green screen option because it kinda hard for me to edit with green screen and i have to go to other editing apps which are a lot more complicating and difficult to use in my opinion. After all Capcut is the most convenient and easy editing app to use.
5,cat person who love cats,I love almost everything about capcut! Just on request could you please add the electric boarder outline that’s my only request other then that it’s all amazing!! All lot other people also like it so I was hoping you could add it back and again everything on there is amazing and this is perfect for beginners especially with all the free choices so I’m hoping you can add it back!! Thank you!
3,bright halo,"So, I like this app it really does seem professional. It is a really cool and fun app to use. But, I was in the middle of making an edit when every time I would try to put an effect it said my connection was not working. So, I kept leaving the app checking my internet. When I finally when't back in to the app all my edited videos were gone including the edit I was making. It still continued to say no internet. This is VERY frustrating and I don’t mean to sound like a mean person but it is."
5,Shiney Potatoe,"I love this app and have been using it for a while! i just have one thing, can you make it so there isnt a limit to overlays? Thats ok if not. And, its always saying my storage is full! I delete so much pictures and it still says it. I even delete edits i kinda liked, but thats still not enough. Can you fix it? I really like this. Otherwise, this is a great editing app! Would recommend"
5,TOXICITY214,"This app is incredible. The fact that this app has any review less than 5 stars is crazy. My guess is that they are possibly next level editors and expected more from an app that’s free. I began my editing on this app and so far I’m very happy. No ads, no pop ups no nonsense. I’ve made some pretty cool content for my Instagram and made funny videos for my friends. It’s great already and any updates to it is just icing on the cake."
3,Bailey Loaf,"Cap cut is really nice and helpful for when I try editing songs for videos, I do have some things that confuse me though. 1, I heard that there was a button that you can turn up/down the vocals or music yet I never found it. 2, I was actually thinking that it would be cool if we were able to combine music together so we can experiment. And lastly, I just am glad ya’ll have the “don’t lock your screen’ and stuff but what if you like- have to go do something and it turns off automatically?"
5,haileyo82,"I’ve used CapCut for as long as I can remember; but for some reason when I click in on the new graphs button the little box appears at the bottom of my screen but there’s a grey tint over everything so I can’t click on it, and it says “use graphs to customize transitions between key frames”; if there’s any way you can help that would be appreciated!! And keep up the good work!"
5,Smack dabbing,"I used to love and use cap cut, but now I don’t, I enjoyed making little edits with danganronpa characters and stuff, but now I can’t, I had to delete a lot of things, and despite that, it said I had “Insufficient storage. Clear up some more and try again.”, or something along those lines. I’m not sure why it does this, but I hope it stops because cap cut is really easy to use and I can make good edits with it"
3,disapointed .,The stock photos were so much storage that it made my phone go to 4GB and so then I tried deleting stuff and it glitched my storage saying I wasn’t deleting when I was. I think there should be a place where you can recover permanently deleted or to be deleted projects. I was working very hard on an edit and couldn’t go back into the app bc of the storage and so I had to delete the app and I lost everything. There should be a place when you delete the app you can recover your stuff. Please fix this.
4,I sit Everyday,"this app is amazing! i like that there are no watermarks and everything is free. there would be some features i would like to added. there are no formats so we need to get a picture/screenshot as the format. it would be easier if we had an option where we can choose our format. there are many transitions or animations that are hard to find. it would be nice to add a search bar for them. in addition to that, graphs would be very helpful. next, when we add animations, we should put it where we want (i’m not good at wording). i want to put the animation at a certain segment. i’m really bad at making transitions so maybe you could also put the animation in the the transition option between the pictures/videos. it would be very helpful! other than that this is a great app!"
5,nagitokinnieuwu,"I love this app so much! But I have some suggestions such as, a graphs feature to go along with key frames. If you’ve seen a lot of editing apps have this, graphs would be an amazing edition to the app. Graphs basically control the speed of how fast the transition goes (ones that are presets). I’ll add on to this in the future, but graphs is really something I’d like to see added in the future! I have a lot of fun with this app :)"
4,something i dont know,"CapCut is a really amazing app to edit but I just have some suggestions for this app, for the animations, can you guys make the animations like video star transition like? I mean I love love the animations but I just wanna suggest like video star or ae transitions so it can be more like an editing app, the second one I suggest is that we need more stickerssss lol, and lastly, we need a thing where you save the video you edited and it has an option where you choose if you want it HD or not, that is all of my suggestions! Thank u!"
4,your sister drista,"CapCut is an amazing app for beginner editors and it doesn’t delete photos in your videos if you delete them on your Camera app (unlike Something master app). If you are a beginner go to this app for more editing skills and make a bunch of videos! So the reason I rated it 4 stars is because it’s overall amazing, but kind of getting boring like I would like some new effects and transitions and etc so hopefully the creator reads this and adds for stuff!"
5,jUsT a FaN 👌,"Hi! I think your app in wonderful. I recently started editing and this app is a great way to start someone off. Though, I do have a suggestion to make this app even better. Could you try adding an account feature? I mean one where you could save all your projects on that account and continue on another device. Thank you for taking the time out to read this and I hope you have a great day/night!! 🤗🤗"
5,BeatMiser,"I’m a teacher and this year I’m going to, from time to time, need record lessons and messages for my students. I just bought a green screen and was looking for an app with a good chroma key feature. I tried Kinemaster, PowerDirector, and even iMovie. But none of them did what I needed. CapCut did EXACTLY what I was looking for. I don’t know how this app is FREE, but I’m not complaining!!! 🤣🤣🤣 A+ app that I HIGHLY recommend to everyone reading this review!!!"
5,FamDiaz,I did a highlight reel of my football season with this app and it’s is so nice it had all the things I could ask for like slow mo reverse special effects such as an explosion fire and lightning different filters and other cool effects. So far this app is amazing and the best editing tool I have ever used. Theres also no ads and I didn’t crash once. Also all the features are completely FREE🤑🤑
5,Best person in the city,Well when I was a beginner\my first time playing it was so easy you can go to effects and just have a good video. I would recommend for you to use this app I know they put a lot of work in to this app. And when I got this app I was vary impressed by all the work they put in to it . I found it off of TikTok And you can do like any thing on it. So that’s why you should get the app!
5,you better read this👀,I use it up for many Gacha life videos I am a gotcha tuber and as being a YouTuber or a Gacha tuber guess this app is really easy to use for beginners I started using it a long time ago I’ve used it for about a couple years now and it’s really really really good! 10 out of 10 recommend it but that’s just my opinion if you look more in the ratings you may see horrible comments saying this is a horrible app:(
3,Its_WilliowxD,"So it’s good for beginner editing I have recently switched to a different editing platform because I want to grow my skills I have used a CapCut for at least 6 to 7 months it’s a really good app after all I connected it to my TikTok account and for some reason it would say no Internet connection even though I have three bars and then it would always say that and I had to delete the app and re-download it same thing with iTunes it shows up and doesn’t let me click on it, The app is overall fine!"
5,uNkOwN-aNoNyMoUs,"This app is pretty awesome. I use it A LOT and make a bunch of really awesome edits. Here are some cons: Sometimes it doesn’t let you add photos. You have to close out, then go back in. Takes up a lot of storage. Pros: you can brag to your friends about your awesome edits. It lets you do a lot of stuff (velocity, key frames, animations, etc) for free! If your looking through the ratings to see if the app is any good, then trust me, download it right now!"
4,ME_luv_ROBLOX!-SOmuch9,"I have used CapCut for a while now, and it didn’t take me a while to figure out what to do (like it the preview says “easy to use”) But I just wanted to point out some bugs. (idk if the bugs are from  me or the app in general)   Bug 1: I can’t explain it well but toward the end of my clip it won’t let me go any further as if the end of the video is there. (which it isn’t) I mean, you can stop it by getting rid of the tab and go back in but, it wold be nice if I didn’t do that.  Bug 2: no photos. I have photos, but sometime when I want to add some, it just says I have no photos. Like bug 1, just fix it by getting rid of the tab then going back in.  And that’s all I have to say really. But in general this app is great for beginners and I really do recommend it!"
5,XxAlienAlohaxX,"This is an amazing app for beginning editors! The animations, fuses between clips, effects, filters, etc. One thing that’s needs to be added is just a bit more voice effects such as auto tune, synth, etc. Just an overall tremendous app for editing, quick and easy, not to mention without having to pay a monthly fee for extra options unlike other apps I’ve seen and tried."
5,Tyaiki,So i just started a new business and have tried several apps to help me create videos to advertise. Most of them are intimidating and difficult to use. I am not experienced in this field at all. This app is so user friendly. It has boosted my confidence and has made me want to learn more about video editing. The features are great and the app is well put together. I would definitely recommend this app. IT IS AMAZING AND I AM SO GLAD I FOUND IT!!!
5,"Gless,","This app lets me take my edits into serious matter and helps me during a presentation in class/Work or with family. There are varieties of effects and materials to edit pictures or videos, I have been using this app for about I’m not sure 4-5 months now, and I highly recommend this app for anyone who wants to look into options and who enjoys taking the time to edit stuff for fun or work!!"
1,"305$/!,@:'","This app is fine. For the most part it’s great, but the other half isn’t. Whenever I’m working on a huge project and try to make another video on capcut it says I have no storage left and I deleted over 100 photos and still have no storage. This app is horrible when it comes to that part. No other apps do that. Capcut isn’t reliable and I’ve been using it for a long time now. It’s getting worse. I also feel like the key frames should be smoother when it comes to remaking an edit. Can you please fix this. Other than that I absolutely love the app. I just hate when it comes to storage. It’s an absolute disaster. Thank you."
5,I love roblox Ok ok ok,Ok 5 stars! BECAUSE THIS APP LIGIT SAVED MY LIFEEE 🦋☺️ soo I started a Tiktok acc (cloudychix) Witch Is a ✨FANPAGE✨ for Charli and Dixie 💕 so My Friend and i are the owners! And My friend uses “videostar” to edit witch I guess is good! But hard for me ☹️ Well I couldn’t Find an app so I started searching for one ☝️ and the first one the pops out is CapCut! So I Download IT and Bro Let Me tell You ☁️ This Saved my life! I made my first edit of Charli (idol) And it was so good I got so many view in Tiktok and I was so Suprised! ☺️ This app is amazing! I recommend It!
5,𝒮𝓉𝑒𝓅𝒽𝒶𝓃𝒾𝑒,"This app is like... WOW. You don’t have to pay for anything, no ads, no premium, and the transitions are REALLY good. There are so many things you can do. There is no watermark, HECK, its ASKS yoy if you want to add the watermark, no payment. You can also grap audio’s from vids on your phone or use one of theirs which is really nice.I do t see any problems with it. If you are a person who likes to make edots of tv shows, people, or something like that, try this app."
4,Jaz-e <3,"Do I have the newest update, yet I still can’t do the auto velocity. The option doesn’t even pop up. I have read the directions how to do it but it still never works. Even when I try to add a style for example “3D Zoom” it still doesn’t work. It always says “Can’t adjust current clip”. I have tried so many times yet it still does not work. And as I said yea I have the latest version. But everything else is fine."
5,flowerful333,"This app is overall amazing but we have one problem is that we can’t type any foreign letters, we obviously can in the typing bar, but it shows a totally different symbol as appeared in the screen, but the one in the typing bar stays the same.  For example lets say English is a foreign language to Thai, we put the letter P in the typing bar, but as it appeared on the screen it’s a litter B. Get what im saying?"
4,emme 💗,"I absolutely love Capcut I edit and it’s soooo helpful but I have a slight problem when I add text then animation sometimes the animation doesn’t work, I will add it it works then I add another text and add it’s animation but then the first one doesn’t work besides from that I DEFINITELY recommend this app it has so many features and is so simple to understand, hopefully this small bug gets fixed and everything will be completely perfect"
5,Salsa Panda,"I love CapCut because I always use it to make edits, and it’s just really fun to play around with. One suggestion I have is that (I also make edit audios) if you could maybe add a feature where yon can muffle the sound of the music being used, that’d be awesome :) Like enough that you can hear it, but it’s muffled for the ✨aesthetics✨ lol it’s okay if not I understand but that’d be really cool to be able to do. Thanks!  -S"
4,ted 5464647547784,"So I’ve been using this app for about 2 months now and I’m having a problem with it, every time I try to upload my tiktok music it just says “ no internet connection “ or if not that not even half of my sounds will pop up I always have to re down load the app when it says no internet connection. So if you could fix these issues thank you, but I’m very impressed by how easy this app is to work!"
4,Hannah Banana ❤️🍌,"I LOVE Capcut! It’s easy & simple to use. It has a lot of great features that are outstanding even compared to more expensive computer applications. There’s only one feature that doesn’t match up with other apps, the speed changing operation. Unfortunately, the slow motion is anything but smooth and practically unusable for anything professional. This would make a 5 star review if the speed changing function were suitable."
4,Chef Pallabi,Hii! I LOVE CapCut but there some cons and something you could add in my opinion. First off it’s a great editing app for people and it’s pretty easy to use. But when I want to upload a YT video (I do crop it to 16:9) but it turns out REAL small soo idk you know? Also here are some recommendations! First can you add where like you can add you installed fonts? Since I want to use this font called Cheri but I can’t download and put in CapCut! I think that’s all my recommendations for now! Awesome app btw!
5,mirayizzyizzard123,How do use this app all the time it’s a really good app I love I will let you make your own edits I made an edit of my dog and he’s so cute and I love how you can add more than one sound when I was making that edit I accidentally ran out a sound so I looked and see if I could add another sound so I found a good sound and I added it in with it and it sounded so good at the end it looked so pretty and that’s why I gave this app a five Star rating!
4,_Just_Cxrmal_,"Capcut was like the app I actually downloaded and it was good but when I didn’t use it for a while :< I clicked on the vids I made and the thing pop up the screen and it said “ this project requires update note that this may consume cellular data” and I want to know why is it there I used the app like “2 apps” on it and how hard I work on the edits, so I may want to know why it keeps popping up in the screen and I really really want to see the edit of mine :("
4,Jsjdhehshsbd,"I have at least 4 editing apps and this one is the the best! You can add music and extract sounds! Overlay and effects! There is just one thing that is getting me frustrated. From time to time it will kick me out off the app. The progress is kinda saved, tho. It will kick me out when I’m trying to and an animation and when I go back in the animation isn’t there. If they fixed this glitch my rating would definitely be a 5 star.         Thanks for reading this!"
5,dab on them haters!!!!!!!!!!!,"Capcut, I don’t know if anyone else is having these problems but I know I am. I’m having to delete all of my edits because it takes up to much “space” and now I’m left with one video and it’s saying that it’s taking up to much space. This is really getting on my nerves because I’m having to delete edits I’ve worked hard on and not finished, because of this."
4,discord liker,A really great app but sadly it’s slightly laggy and considering that I use this app for editing and making videos if you put the speed too high they would lag and would be really glitchy going forward and if you put too much short layers it would just freeze. I get that it’s a free app with no logo and it’s not supposed to be great but it’s really annoying. I hope this feedback is somewhat noted. This for me besides that I would rate it a 5 or 4.9.
4,🍇Ouma-Chan!🍇,"I really love the app and all but I want to talk about one thing I hope you can fix. It’s about the overlays and effects. I want to put the effects on the overlays as if it was on the image etc. I’ve been trying to make it shake and flash but it ends up not doing it on the overlay and just doing it on the image. Please , I would love if you a second option to put the effects on the overlay. If someone can help me , I really don’t know if you can still do this."
4,APPLEKID18,"I have been ushering Capcut for several months now and I really enjoy how easy it is to navigate and use it but as I am progressing I wish some thing where more actuate like the volume section u can barely raise or lower the volume.😐I love the filters bcc they are nice and my style but I think that there sound be a little more than like 10,but overall this app is really good if u are new to editing but is u are Proish at editing u would look into getting something better"
4,KawaiiKumiko,"This app is great, it has so many high quality options to edit all the whole being free! Though it would be nice to have the function of splitting screen with two or more vids, some of the editing I want to do require this so I have to do it on a different app, which is a bit annoying but not a big deal I guess. It’s just nice to have everything in one app so it’d be fantastic if this function is added! Otherwise I’m very satisfied!"
4,hockey4801,"I use this for almost all vids and edits but the only downside is when using overlay, like green screen and such, it tends to move to a random spot in your video like not where you want it to, so it tends to be very annoying having to place it to its assigned spot in the video. And no, moving the overlay is not MY actions. Same goes for audio. I am kindly asking the creators to fix this and maybe I’ll give it fives stars like most of the others with the same issue."
5,KodnerTheBot,"This app is amazing! We get to use everything on the app for free, and there’ no watermark. There is one problem though, so every time  I edit, and try to playback the audio is delayed and the sounds don’t sync up. But when you export it, all the sounds are in sync, and you can also just go back a little bit in the recording. So besides that problem, I think Viamaker is great!"
5,horsegirl3012,There’s just one thing with cap cut I love this app!!! It’s free and everything is free on the app! But just be careful because the one thing I hate about this app is there newest songs have the F WORD IN THEM!! and my 9 year old brother was using it and heard it!! They have a lot of the F words and S words in there newer songs so just be carful with this around younger kids and please change this cap cut because younger kids do use this!!!
5,Lizaall@127,"I want to get capcut on laptop or pc or other devices because I can't use a lots of videos and photos in Ipad or phone, even my ipad storage is full right now. In laptop we can use a lots of videos and photos as we want so please make quickly !! Also smooth slow motion really help me. I want more auto shakes, more effect, like AM and more animations of texts."
4,Wildcraft is not good,There… is a issue whenever I save a edit and want to make a new one it’s say I don’t have enough storage.. so I deleted the edits I made and see if it will work but it said the same thing then I went to photos and delete the ones I don’t need an then.. it said the same thing I deleted the app cuz I thought it was a glitch then I re download it.. same thing so now I don’t know how to edit if I deleted the edits in my photos can you pls fix this if you could?..
5,SunniBo,"Free, no watermark, powerful, easy to use… Sign me up!  Used this app for a couple of weeks/months now and its been amazing so far. Im not the best video editor so I dont know the full capabilities of this app, but i do know there is much more to it than I think.  Would love a pc version if possible but using it on a phone or tablet feel just about right… for now.  The people who worked of this app would make a killing porting it to windows 10 or mac. That been said it is alot more work but with the capabilities of pc its possible they can cram alot more features into it.  If you hadn’t noticed i would love a pc version. (Heres to hoping)  Anyway, if you’re on the fence about getting this app, you should… plain and simple"
5,hiiiiiiiiishdvdb,CapCut is a pretty good app but when my storage gets fall I delete so many things and it still says I am not able to access it but overall it’s pretty good but maybe it could be just a little bit better because a lot of apps I see are pretty good but I’ve seen about maybe two of them that look better than that so maybe it just needs to add a tiny bit more
4,critical drinker,"So far, this app has been good to me. But sometimes it can be a bit buggy. for example, i was trying to edit a reaction video i made, but couldn’t play it back because it was so buggy. Every time i tried it would just do nothing at all. And I couldn’t extract audio because it wouldn’t show any of the buttons. Like i said, this app is very good and i totally recommend it for editing, but these bugs need to be fixed."
5,missflutist,"So I use capcut for making edits, but here’s a problem I keep on running into, no matter how many times I reboot and/or delete then reinstall the app: whenever I try to choose an animation for a certain part, usually it displays how it’s gonna be, but now it’s blank and when I choose it, it loads, then it says “Connect to the internet and try again”."
5,Kay Baxley,"I’ve been editing for almost a year. I’ve tried various apps but never had found one with the effects I wanted for a good price. At least, until 10 minutes ago. I SERIOUSLY DOWNLOADED THE APP 10 MINUTES AGO AND IM ALREADY OBSESSED OVER IT! Tons of effects and stickers FOR FREE! With no watermark as well! It’s simple to use also. I immediately understood how to add photos and videos to the project. It’s incredible! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this app for any editor, new or advanced."
5,☀️✨Lunar :3,"I friend told me about this app and I thought it was a waste of time at first, but it Is amazing. There are layers, Its 100% free, and they have tons of transitions, stickers, and filters. Not to mention it has NO WATERMARK which I think is insane. The only problem is the audio/songs, it’s pretty bad quality but I usually use another editing app to add the audio and then I crop it. So it’s not really an issue with me! Overall 100% recommended"
5,ILIKECHIPS0-0,I really love this app. The effects and all but recently it doesn’t let u download the effects which I found weird I thought it was only me but I texted my cousin and the same thing goes for her. And I don’t know what caused that to happen bc yesterday the app was working fine. I deleted and downloaded it again and I still got the same problem. Can you please fix this?
5,PurplePepperRealone,"I love using this editor so much, but there are a lot of glitches.. sometimes the audio doesn’t work when you cut it in half, sometimes when uploading a video it seems like the editing sometimes doesn’t catch every edit accurately, and when you try to zoom an image in or out it obnoxiously snaps inti a smaller image when i try to make it bigger."
5,mizz._.lani,I use this app ALL the time I love it so much!!! But also I had a recommendation that would make it much easier for some people that use this app. You should add where you can combine the animations that you guys already have in here! It would be really cool and could help out with things and make even more better creations! Please just take it into thought and think about it! Love this app❤️.
5,mini💕💕💕,"It’s an very good editing app. It has lots of great affects, and it’s awesome! So, if you are going to use CapCut, here are some useful tips! Tips: when you are going to put music in your video, do not use the voice one, unless you are going to do an voice over. Screen record the music, edit the music,  then  you can put the music. And also you can there are music that CapCut put, you can also use that."
4,zeldalucarioanimaljamnelop,"This app is really great. I use it all the time, but there is a problem when I try to export my edit and it says I don’t have enough storage. Even when I try to delete other edits I have made it still will tell I don’t have enough storage. And now it will not even allow to view my edit when I tap on my edit it says I don’t have enough storage. This total ruins The app. If you see this then please fix that. Thanks!"
5,Kaylah Parra,"I love cap cut I use it to edit, but maybe you can update it for us like maybe you can add this feature where we can add fonts we want bc sometimes I get tired of the e fonts we have and I want to add new fonts that I like if that’s okay, maybe you can add a new update where we can add fonts for people who have iOS and new animations for text but other than that CapCut is really good I recommend it 100%"
3,catlife1234567,"I had made about 3 video edits before the storage went out, that might be my fault though- as many times I try to fix this it just doesn’t work. I was able to use any other editing app I had but this one just didn’t work anymore, sorry if I am just being stupid but this is just kinda annoying. Anyways with the whole problem this is a really good app for beginners and it’s easy to figure out what you need to do, I hope this was helpful in some way.   Bye!"
4,notnsnha,"This app is Amazing! It has everthing that you could ever need! I use this app for insta and tiktok and get about 1k likes per vid, and all bye using this app! I really like it but some times to delays, for example I was doing an edit on a sound from tiktok, when I went to look at the edit that I made ON Capcut the sound we delayed, and yes i looked at it before but when I downloaded it to my camera roll it was delayed, but in conclusion this is a great app and y’all should use it"
4,Rat😌✨,"Hello capcut! I would like to say the the things that bother me! It would a Really nice if  you COULD stop saying""no internet connections, connect to the internet and try again.""That really bothers me and it would be nice if you put the app to where it doesn't need internet thank for reading my Review Thank and also please make it a lot easier to find Different effects Its really hard to fine some! Thank you! 🤍🖤"
4,Arianna Toro,idk if this is happening to other people but i was doing a gacha edit but the app kept crashing and i think it had something to do with the overlay i think it’s called because when i delete some of the overlays it works perfectly no glitches nothing but when i put more it gets very glitchy and breaks my game if you could fix this it would help me a lot and other people too if there having the same problem.
5,ahahaue,"In my opinion this app is better than any other edit app I’ve ever used, the way that it’s free, has no watermark, and even has transitions that don’t need you to get a free trail on them blows my mind ! The built in stickers to make a cool edit is what really caught my mind, I love it so much it took me a while to find a good edit app but this! This is it ! Please never remove this app from the App Store!"
1,Neila K.,"But there is a problem, every time I try to save a video it says insignificant storage, so I exit out of the app deleting 50 or more videos and photos and then I get back into the app and it still says the same thing and when I exit out of the app again to delete more videos and photos it says it again but this time when I press on the video I edited, it said insignificant storage again, I thought deleting the app and downloading it would fix it but it didn’t. I kept doing that and it wouldn’t stop doing that and now I have to use another persons phone to edit my videos and photos."
5,really great app love ot,"So I saw this girl edit on this app,and I wanted to make an short and simple edit,and got some picture from google,and the effects are SOO GOOD,and I don’t have to spend money on after effects and because I don’t have a laptop,but anyways this app is amazing after all,my edit that I made for my sister who loves this website game called Friday night funkin,and made and edit of her favorite boy,and she loved it"
5,This thing heyday,"freaking extraordinary. works extremely well. absolutely adore, especially because there isn’t a watermark. doesn’t lag for me as well. The only complaint is that I cut the video at the wrong time and now I cant go back. oops, might’ve just been my mistake. you can only undo what you have just done, and then back. other than that happening I’ve loved it so far."
4,bruhhhhh this gsmewe,"This app is such an amazing app with so many amazing affects, transitions and other abilities. However, I do find this app needing an update, For example the music cuts off so easily and it’s very hard to control the layers. I honestly think that they need a better music and I really hope that they add an update because there are a couple things that they could change. But I think that this is a strong editor and has amazing features!"
5,Kammywilk,let me start off by saying i love this app. it’s super easy to use and it’s pretty good quality photos. i use the match cut often so i can synchronize transition to beat changes but i wish there was a way to have two or more colors. sometimes the constant yellows confuse me especially if i want to do like layers so that’s a suggestion for the next update maybe !
4,5 stars really good!,"It’s a pretty good app! There’s somewhat a lot you can do and it’s fun (to me) to make stuff, although there is a low limit of layers that you can add which is ig lame? It would be more easier to make animations and edits that acquire more movement then normal, and the filters are really the best and are sort boring. And even if the cut was too ‘short’ It would be maybe a little nicer to have it so you can do it however short it is, it would be more helpful with animation, edits, mini movies, etc  So pretty much it would just be: •have a higher limit of layers •try to make the filters a little less boring And •MAYBE make it so you can edit the movement type thing with it being however short it is  But it’s honestly a really good app for mini movies/episodes and small edits :)"
5,bfjudufjkfj,Hi! So I have been using CapCut for a month and I’m so addicted to it! IT HAS ANY FEATURE NO OTHER APP COULD HAVE!! There is no way this app can have hate my favorite parts are the effects stickers and text! And I love the new update! Capcut is the number one app anyone could use! It’s extremely easy 100% FREE!!! And ta cool free app with SO MANY GOOD FEATURES COULD BE ALL FREE!! If this app had in app purchases it would be WORTH EVERY PENNY !! Whoever is reading this PLEASE I BEG OF YOU DOWNLOAD CAPCUT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF!!! Thank you so much for this app!
3,bearingtom,"this app is amazing! I love it has no watermark, has filters, you can add your own sound and so much more! but I hope you can make a update to fix some bugs. it never really loads, whenever I close out of the project it saves but it doesn’t load all these mini pictures in my edit (if that makes sense). and so I keep hanging to redo it over and over again but sometimes I have to go and if the project doesn’t load I can’t finish it. please respond to this and please change this."
5,Ahri Lore,"So usually I’ve been having issues with other editing apps & came upon this one, I really didn’t think of anything at first until I made a small music clip & let me tell you I was actually in shock that I made such thing. I would recommend anyone to use this app, if I still haven’t convinced you then at least give it a try & see how it goes. I promise you won’t regret it. <3"
3,MrMarsh_13,I absolutely love this app. Endless possibilities and power of creativity is literally at the fingertips of your hands. I used this app multiple times and I have enjoyed using editing software to make audio for my friends. But the update ruined that because most of the base boosted audio I had just stopped working and any other attempts to fix it just result. The bass boost is what really made me enjoy this app and now it feels a little less enjoyable without it. Please bring back the base boost.
4,ghktyw,"So, this app is amazing! has great effects, easy to use, and its free. but theres one thing. it sometimes glitches, and says it need to allow it to use my camera and when i try to allow it, it doesnt even give an option to allow it! i then have to delete the app, redownload it, and wait a few hours to even do anything. which is annoying because then all my progress is lost. pleaseee fix this! ❤️"
4,🏳️‍🌈𝘴𝘱𝘳𝘬𝘺🏳️‍🌈,"This app is the best editing app ever no watermark, everything is free, amazing transitions, and more... but there are so annoying parts like when you editing with photos for a gacha movie or skit when I click the photo it sends me to the transitions tab and it just gets me annoyed, it’s also laggy and it sometimes glitches so when I’m done editing I rewatch it to make sure everything is ok, and then it stays on a photo and I get frustrated. But over all this is an amazing app"
5,visualspill,"Who in the world bothers to write reviews?  I sure don't. If the app is bad, delete it. If the app is good, hold on to it.  I have NOT ONCE in TEN years felt that an app was SO good, that I just HAD to write an honest review.  I just feel like I shouldn't keep it a secret.  So, I'm here to tell you all, this app will literally blow you away!  It's free for starters, no gimmick no catch it's free. They may have premium options but to be honest I haven't noticed them.  This app does EVERYTHING that you could possibly want to do with your video.  I've made amazing high quality premium videos very quickly, very easily and for FREE.  If your searching the App Store, just stop. Stop now and download this app.  Thank me later."
5,layla theis,"This app is amazing, 100% recommend this if your looking to edit. Love the transitions to it and all the stuff you can do. I looked at the reviews. You guys have to realize that it’s YOUR problem you don’t have enough storage, or YOUR problem you can’t take time to practice on a app. It’s not capcuts fault.  I just really wish this could have more transitions, and better text effects ^^"
4,Treasure_kat,I will be trying to make a edit but when I go to get a picture or edit something on a different app it always freezes so I exit the app but then when I go back in says I don’t have enough storage on my phone but I do because I don’t have a lot of photos or tabs open so I do not understand why it’s not working.   I’m not sure if this is a glitch or bug but I would like if you fixed it😅   Thank you.
4,_riicard.o,"I recently made a video and the video will come out lagged or behind its sound when while editing it was fine. I don’t know if it’s a bug or not because I usually don’t have problems exporting a video and it being the same as what I edited. But this time the effects are lagged and also the sound doesn’t match the video when in editing mode it is fine, will def change to 5stars when this gets fixed!"
5,twinz yay,"Hi ! the app is amazing but it does have its flaws, i’m an editor and it’s hard for me to export different fonts from different shows when you don’t have that option (hopefully that’ll come it the next update?) also the volume quality is great but it’s not loud enough or quiet enough when needed if that makes sense, i’m just hoping for exporting texts and different clips and better volume :)"
4,AMG2011😐,"Every time i want to make a edit but i want to use transitions or effects and anything else i use to make my edit, so i decided to log on a couple days ago and it said “No connection try again later” so i just thought it was a bug in the app so i decided to leave it but today it still wouldn’t work so i just deleted the app but still wouldn’t work so i was wondering if you guys could fix it?"
4,gacay,I am very pleased to have this app.  It is free and I’ve been seeing reviews everywhere about this app and I wanted to get it but I never had the time to download it.  When I first downloaded it it looked very easy to work. And I was right! I was very surprised on how I learned how to work this app in a matter of time ps: I am not very good at learning stuff like this.  I don’t have any complaints on this app. Hope you guys are hyped on editing on your new software... CapCut!
5,Hungryplayer9999999,I’ve downloaded many apps like this before and they all are trash. Always asking me to buy a membership or some kind of vip but not this one. I haven’t gotten a single ad or annoying pop-ups asking to buy a membership. All the effects are really cool and the filters are the cherry on top. Super easy to use and great for beginner editors. Some of my best edits have come from this app.
4,sticking samantha,"capcut is a very nice editing app, and is very easy, fun, simple to use. I’ve been using it for a few years and it upgraded a lot! Though, if you’re trying to learn how to edit still, I recommend don’t use to many effects that’ll make the vid not visible to see :)) I wouldn’t give it a 5/5 because sometimes, it’s really stresses me out cuz the vid lags alot when I add too many effects/overlays. it’s not rly capcuts fault tho. overall great app, recommend using!!"
5,Its SmileyEllaa,"Very good app. Whenever I use it to edit, I get amazing edits. It’s just when I have to do my own velocity and not do the auto velocity, it gets a bit hard. Also when I try to get pictures, sometimes it says that I have no pictures and I have to open the app again so I can had a picture. The stickers are good that I have so many edits in mind, and so hard to pick! Very good stickers!"
4,i do not fart,"This is an overall awesome editing app however, I’m currently trying to overlay things to make tweeting but when I try to overlay 3 or more it will black screen and lag. This is really annoying when I’m trying to make and edit and I can’t fix it. But overall capcut is great and I love it because it’s easy to use unlike other complicated phone editing apps and I love the animations! Just this glitch is very annoying"
4,PsychoEVIL#7178,"I like it, it’s a very good app it’s just every time I go on it when I want to use some songs from TikTok it just says I need a internet connection when I have one so then I have to uninstall it every time for it to let me use my TikTok favorite sounds but on top of that is doesn’t show me my new favorite songs I add plz try to fix this it really irritates me and if it is fixed then I will add the one star that’s really the only reason I don’t have it at 5 stars"
4,Coffee maker😱😑🤯😁😄😤😄😤,"I been using capcut for some time now and I discovered some glitches that kinda annoy me. The first glitch is that when I want to put a photo it says I have no photos, it’s annoying. Second glitch is when I want to put a effect is glitches and does not put it on and it gets annoying when you have to do it over and over again, but overall it’s a really good app I recommend for beginners, etc ❤️"
4,RosePrincessOfmagic,Can you please fix this because I deleted a bunch of pictures and I wish I can get them back so basically when I try to edit a video or make a video it won’t let me I deleted a bunch of pictures and deleted it after and I am so frustrated because I really don’t understand what’s going on but I’m just gonna tell you this this is a good app but I really need something if you can fix this bug or is it?
5,Hstratz,"The way it looks makes it feels seem easy and easy to edit, I also love how the transitions make everything seem like the edit is better, The green screen tool is also amazing! and I love how you can add your own audio from you camera roll, and the stickers and effects make it better! and a lot of updates is just outstanding!! i love love this app!!! :)"
3,JiyoungLol,"The app is amazing, I was so glad it was free when I got it. But I have a problem. When trying to upload a video that’s 2 minutes, it doesn’t let me. It’s in my camera roll but will never pop up everytime I try to upload it. I wish you’d add a feature where you could upload videos over 2 minutes. It’s really a pain in the neck when I spent hours trying to make a video and I can’t put sound because the video of the sound is over two minutes."
5,13wosoddh39,everything is great on CapCut but there's one big flaw. it compresses the videos by a considerable amount  why it doesn’t give you an option to give the raw video instead of saving  space on. different editing software give you 4K 60 non compressed the Best it can give you 1080p 60 compressed. that’s why I switch my videos look so much better. I use alightmotion now it wayyy better
5,selzyo,"I love this app a lot!!! I had only a little experience in video editing and this app made it extremely simple to video edit. There are no watermarks, which I love, easy to use, and free! I use this app to edit videos and it’s very fun. I love how this app has easy-access transitions and I am able to understand it very easily. This app is so diverse with their transitions and effects, considering it’s free!!!! Keep up the good work, CapCut!!!"
4,Zyebabez,"I use an IPad 7 for almost everything. I was trying to edit videos, I just downloaded the app it was working fine a few minutes in though it had started to glitch from me putting effects. I was making another video later on. I tried to import 30 photos and once I tried to continue It was loaded and then stop and my app froze."
5,ZoeyLu85,"I love this app because I use iMovie (which is another editing software I use) and when I would try to add photos, the photos would move around. And then when I would edit it, it would stay in one place of the photo. But this app is amazing because it stands straight for the photos. And really easy to edit! You have a lot more options to use on CapCut! It helps me a lot with my YT channel🤩           YT channel: Zoey The RAWR"
5,Adri011508,"okay I don’t write any reviews like ever. But it’s awesome and just want everyone (like me) who enjoys editing to have this🤩. I use it for all my edits, not rlly anything you can’t do on it, completely free. Highly recommend, even if u don’t like it you should at least download and mess around with it for a while. Thanks for reading! Also if you wanna check out some edits I’ve made with it go look at my tik tok: Offixial_adxi"
5,k_army_b,"I have been looking for an app to make edits for tiktok on, and let me tell you, this is the freaking app. It is easy to use, it has multiple layers (so you can put videos on videos), you can easily move the videos, it has free transitions (THE TRANSITIONS ARE SO COOL), and so much more. If you need an app for edits, this is it. 11/10 very good. No watermarks and you don’t have to pay for the good stuff. This is the only app I use for edits."
5,kirusu boy in the house!,Okay so as an gachatuber this is amazing I can do anything that I want everything free it just amazing! You can delete the data! And save space! This editer is underrated there should be more people using it it’s amazing! To anyone who is interested in getting the editer get it! It absolutely amazing! But could you maybe do one thing for like stickers and stuff like overlays could you make it so that I like pops up maybe?
5,Saribeari17,"I can’t believe it’s free and I’m surprised they’re still adding a few more more things. There is one problem tho it lags a bit and I can’t use the effects for some reason. If I try to use any effects I didn’t download it keeps on saying I’m offline when I’m literally in the same room as the WiFi router and my WiFi is on. Can you please fix this problem, I would really appreciate it"
5,ycfucufxffucc,"Hello I’m a beginner and it has very good quality editing options. since I am a beginner I am not very good at editing, but I do know for one thing that this app will help you very much and can I help you move on to other editing apps like kind master and video star. it is very good and I hope you all enjoy this App is ever his reading this🥰😌😊😍🙂☺️❤️💜🧡🖤💛🤍💚🤎💙❤️‍🔥❤️‍🩹❣️💕💞💓💖💘💝💟"
5,Mellmashmellow,Ok so I love Capcut this app is AMAZING🤩 but recently the app has been lagy I don't know why.. Anyways like i said Capcut is amazing but something I would like in the app is motion blur😌I do edits and motion blur would me amazing 🤩 Just to clears some things up I know that the app has motion blur but it doesn't work very well In my personal opinion it makes the video you're editing blury... Othet then that Capcut is Great!🤩🤩🤩
5,H83,"I’ve been using this app for all editing I’ve done!!!! LIKE I LOVE IT!!!! And it’s completely Free there are NO in app purchases I’ve seen! But there’s one issue so sometimes if you’re editing a clip you’ll try to add an overlay or another clip sometimes it’ll say you have no photos which I know is not true because I have like 2,000 photos on my tablet lol 😂 but yeah that’s really the only issue other than that I LOVE IT!"
5,-Ay Im just yo local weirdo-,"So, ever since my little cousin introduced me to CapCut, I was in love. I could make animations easier and everything! But when I signed into TikTok for sounds, some things went a bit wrong. It was not loading my fav sounds. But that’s fine, I definitely recommend for beginners like me and use your imagination to make all sorts of things! 5 stars :’D"
4,Big ANT DALLAS!,"So I downloaded this app because I wanted to make football edits and this app is perfect for it ! For someone like me who has never even attempted to make a edit this app made it so easy. But the one MAJOR PROBLEM, is that when I want to use a sound from my favorites or original sounds it always says no internet connection when i clearly have internet connection . Is there a way to fix this or no."
5,JustLookingForGames,I love this editing app! I was looking for something to use to edit for a while now and found this! It helps me make so many videos super easily. I don’t think there is any glitches with the app that I know of. It has been a little laggy at times but I think that it’s just because of my internet. This app is great in my opinion. I think a beginning editor should try it!
5,@@@###*@,Ok this app is perfect just that it would be more perfect if you put music sounds like I was doing something but someone tell me that I can’t put music I just can put music recording the music so that makes me sad so if you can add like at least 3 popular song every month it will be awesome. Or if you already have this option of songs pls tall me I need this Thanks for this app
3,chimchimfan,"I’ve had CapCut since August and I don’t if these things are ""new updates"" but one thing I noticed that changed was the volume when I replace a video. I personally don’t like how the volume turns on when I replace the video, and even though I have the volume muted. The next thing I noticed was that the text looks different when I turn on the shadow. Today the text opacity wouldn’t work either. I’m not sure if the first two are glitches but those are some things that have been bothering me."
5,sparkplugh,"First off, I would like to say thank you so much for giving us all the opportunities to edit like a pro this app has really help me have better editing skills but the only problem that lags is whenever I edit my videos I noticed that the transition don't go along with the beat of the song but it'll catch up overall this app is truly the best thing EVER KEEP 👏🏽IT 👏🏽UP👏🏽😤🔥💗"
4,hello kitty <3....,"I love capcus. And since I’m a new edited capcut is a very good app to start with, but there is one bad thing about it. The Quality I really just wish there was a better way to get better quality in my videos. So I hope that capcut can make that effortless way to get a better quality for my videos. But over all capcut is a really good editing app cause it’s very simple and you don’t have to use to much brain to figure out how to use capcut."
5,💖CapCut fan💖,Hello I want to thank you so much for creating this app cause it helps me make a gacha video like the gachatuber I am not one of them cause mom won’t let me but If I did I will always going to be using this app cause a lot of gachatuber use this app and use the text to speech so we won’t be reading long thing and I love how it can read it for you thank you so much CapCut I love your app so much
5,naiejwo,This is a really good app it’s just that when you have to get a new phone or get it fix where you have to restart your phone from the beginning your edits get deleted. So I think it’s best if you guys make it where you have to long into a account that keeps your edits and you don’t have to lose a lot of hard work
5,Eb1234467,"As a YouTuber who primarily records and edits from her phone I was desperate to find an app that was better than Videoshop because it slowly went downhill over the years even though they charged more. All the functionality that Videoshop did away with, I found right here with CapCut!! The only recommendation I have is add a Subscribe and Instagram Logo sticker .. (My apologies if you have it I didn’t see one).."
4,Foxielover,"Look it’s great and all and I love how you can choose almost everything but small disclaimer: Why can’t you search up the sound you are trying to go for? And it’s hurting my brain cause I’m trying to go for a song that goes for this edit- And after all it’s great you can make your edits pop 👄 my sis and me were laughing at this Funniest thing I made, so it bring joy into my family! So thank you for reading this! Sry it was so short.."
5,Nyx07,Very good app I’ve used it my whole life this is the only editing app I could use because all the other apps are so confusing this is the best app I’ve ever tried I’m giving this a five star because it’s so good I love it and it’s amazing it’s so easy to use not hard it’s amazing I love using it every day to edit my videos it’s made me improve a lot through the years
3,Seraphina (UNO),"Capcut is a very good editing app and simple to use, but regarding the smooth slow motion it has a bug that’s really bothering me. When you apply smooth slomo on a cut video it will sometimes changes the video cut, for example if i recorded a 1 minute video and cut the first 20 seconds then applied smooth slomo it might change to the last 20 seconds of the video. This completely removes your progress and if you hit back it removes the slomo which takes a while to load."
4,1ns0nmIac,"Ive used capcut for like a good 4 months but the new update with the velocity i cant find it like at all i dont know if its in my country but its not their i dont see that i have to update, i literally deleted capcut meaning all my videos are gone, so i suggest we put emails or log in so we can go back to our videos if we delete capcut, and also like i said i cant find it so i need a little help finding because its not on my device"
3,superpooper101,"I normally use CapCut for Gacha edits and I am confident of my tweeting abilities. The problem is, CapCut is to laggy and when I try to drag an arm or leg down, it goes up. Same thing in the opposite way. CapCut, please fix this. You would be the easiest app for Gacha tweening if you didn’t have so much lag. Every time I try to tween, I start to cry because of the difficulty. Please CapCut, fix this. Other than that, i would say CapCut isn’t that bad and would recommend to beginners. But like I said, don’t use this app for tweening."
4,queen of thhe jungle,"I love this app! It makes it so easy to edit things and post on tiktok and with it I’ve gotten more proud of my works! The thing is, I’m not gonna be able to continue if it’s gonna make me wipe out my whole storage…it always says I need to clear out stuff and when I clean out 50 things and it still says that, it’s kinda annoying wasting my time for nothing out of it. Someone help fix that cuz it’s getting annoying fast"
5,KENDALL C :D,"When I first got CapCut I thought it it would be like every other video editing app, but this app is absolutely wonderful and I’m obsessed!! It’s so easy to use for beginners and I use it to make edits of my friends!! CapCut has so many premade templates and rlly allows u to create whatever!! You can export your own fonts and create your own colorings!! It is so helpful and overall I just love the app 💕💕"
5,xxkittywatermelon,"When I first got CapCut, i thought it would be hard to use. This would be surprising, being that usually when I download apps for editing, I usually have to watch tutorials. But, I figured it all out by myself! Also, they give you a ton of these cool effects, so it won’t be super hard to use. It is super easy and I promise you won’t regret downloading it!"
5,kaka_v24,This editor app is really good not going to lie it’s really good for “starters” because you have practice on one video or in many videos called “projects”. It will be really cool if it was the same as alight motion because alight motion has more editing options than cap cut + alight motion has “in-app purchases” and cap cut doesn’t. Cap cut will be the best non purchases editing app. I like it too.
4,•maddie14•,Capcut is amazing but… Sometimes it glitches and say you’re out of storage in the app and you need to clear some stuff out but like I’ve  deleted all the edits in there that I’ve done and that I’ve saved and it still says I’m out of storage but I think it’s a really good app like I’m a starter editor and I’m not that good at it and I make a bunch of Roblox edits lol but capcut that makes it easy to do it and I really recommend this app and I hope you download it 😃
4,st0rmstar,"It used to be my go-to app whenever I wanted to edit something. It’s worked well for the 3 weeks I’ve been using it, but now I can’t use any transitions, effects, animations, etc. because the app tells me that I’m not connected to the internet, even though I am. I’ve tried disconnecting from the internet and reconnecting, and I’ve deleted the app and reinstalled it, but I still get the same pop up saying I’m not connected to the internet."
5,GamerHamster12,"This app has to be one of THE best editing apps I have ever downloaded. No watermark, no monthly paying subscription, no locked special effects. One thing I suggest is giving it the ability to name the sounds you extracted from videos. After I screen record a video, extract the sound and save it. So that way it makes it more easy to find it and more organized. Just a suggestion."
5,ldbsodbsus,This app is so easy to use like neon it makes everything so easy for you just press a few buttons. You can also make you own like it’s so easy to the sound to making a zoom in and out it’s so easy I love this app so much it’s the app that I will use to edit and it shows the thing that you tubers use when they are like please stand by or something like that I’m in love ❤️
4,.(:&/)3$,"I love CapCut, it is a great editing program that I suggest to Ppl who use Gacha Club or Life or even ppl who do edits. But I have some major issues with the program, every-time I open up the app and try to do some transitions or effects it always says no internet. Which is oddly weird bc I have internet, I would like to use CapCut because it’s probably the only App I know how to use. Please fix this issue."
4,p̰̃ã̰ṵ̃l̰̃ã̰. 乂ᗪ,"Hello. Everything is fine, but In this new version, I have a problem. The problem is that when you’re about to click, erase background, when you eliminate it, It eliminates it in a bad way, I liked more the way before this version. Could you let this new version, but leave the “Eliminate background” like it was before this NEW version. I’ll appreciate it, thank you. Good bye."
5,Tay_OM,"I can’t even sugarcoat anything, idc how everyone else is doing, this app literally changed my life in the best way. It helps me mentally in alot of ways and the workflow Is literally perfect. It crashes sometimes but bro at the cost of free, who cares. I’ve created so many videos for myself and for others and its so fulfilling to use. Thank you so much for this app, true app for creators and MORE. ANYONE can use this app."
4,🧚Fairy🧚,"Something went wrong when I tried to edit and it said “needs access for videos or photos” and I went to my settings and was confused what to do, I started deleting the app and went to the AppStore and when I typed in, “CapCut” I tried uploading in back up in my phone but it didn’t work so I tried again and it didn’t do anything. I don’t know what to do because I had tons of edits I made and I deleted it."
4,Martian_28,"Hey! Thanks for making this app, it really helped me in editing videos and such!  I got some suggestions though, could you add an audio pitch feature? Since I wanna keep the video in normal speed but change its pitch, yeah I can only change the pitch by speeding it up.  And also could you add an audio quality feature too? I like making 2007-styled videos and I like lowering down the sound quality to make the vid more accurate, would be cool if you added it  And one last thing, could you add VHS quality and 1940’s-accurate quality voice effects? Yeah I’m that type of guy that likes making videos from different eras haha, but yeah it would be really nice if you could add the stuff I suggested.  But anyways, cool app!"
4,setfghjf,This object way too much of my storage I’m not able to download any more apps without deleting half of my photos and some other apps I have I don’t like how this works and it takes up way too much I download this app for TikTok and like TickTock works when I edit it but this game is always like no you have to try again delete some story you don’t know how much storage is taking out like some of my favorite forwarders
5,yeamanbri,"Wow I tried using i movie or whatever to try and create something but this is like 100x better.. first of all it’s way simple to find out what to do and you can add cool ways of changing between videos pictures etc, and the most important part as when you save it, it doesn’t come out a super small square like I movie does. + there is no water mark."
5,TheCatBehindTheSlaughter,"So my friend uses this, and I was still using KineMaster, so my friend told me to install this app instead. I was reluctant but did it, and it was TOTALLY worth it. Anyone using KineMaster who wants a step up from it should get this, it’s also easy and simple to use for beginners (like me ;-;) In conclusion, this is an awesome app, that is easy, simple, but also has a lot of opportunities to create things with it.  ~A person 🌺🌸🌱🌼🏵"
5,soOKURA UWU,"Ok, this editing app is pretty good! It was more than I ever expected, It’s super easy, and has a lot of cool features as well! I love editing videos now with this app, It’s easy, and there are a lot of possibilities to making edits/videos/etc. It never really crashes for me, and everything is basically free! it’s amazing, I recommend it for beginners, it’s easy, they’re so many cool affects, stickers, animations, etc!"
5,zoe click,This is the best mobile editing app all my friends who edit use this and their edits look incredible you can do so many things it’s so awesome you can make smooth transitions and at first it’s not hard to figure out to do things and as you use it and use it and use it it gets so much easier this is the best editing app for mobile (in my opinion) I highly suggest you get this app!!
1,nooby duddey,I love making funny and random videos with this app but most of the time I can only make at least one and I have like hardly any games and like no videos so I don’t understand it says it says no storage why I’m not even gonna save it on my iPad so it’s just so dumb that it says no storage you can’t even create any of these like I want to create them without having no storage anyways I’m sorry I gave you a one star but I just had to because this is the most annoying thing I’ve ever dealt with in a app.   But anyways it’s a great app other than that I like making funny videos with it keep up the good work!
4,Nsrumee,"Ive been using capcut for a while, but yestereday it stopped working for me. When i tried to click effects or animations, it said ""no internet connection, try again."" however, my internet was perfectly fine. I didnt know why it did this, so i just deleted the app and reinstalled it, yet it still didnt work. I also downloaded it on my another phone, and it worked there. is there anything i can do to fix this?"
5,Holcroft,I love that this app is free and it comes with so much stuff that are very helpful and convenient. I only have 2 minor problems. 1 the audio adjustment is not the best and could be better. 2 it has auto captions I think that is really cool but it is only in English and sometimes I don’t want to have to type out all the captions for my anime edits. Over all it is an amazing app and the best for your time.
4,RETR0ALITY,"I just have one suggestion that would make things so much easier. Ok, so when ever adding a new clip or making a clip longer, all the effects ,which were lined up with other clips, get moved. Making it a tedious process to line them back up again. I think there should be some type of function that like pins the effect to the clip. It will make editing a lot easier in my opinion."
5,A random girl you don't know,CapCut is an amazing app for editing and its totally free but i have one recommendation for the auto velocity. I think that for the auto velocity you should make it so you are able to pick where the velocity beat hits and make it so you can change how fast or how slow the beat is. Overall the app is amazing and i will continue to use it in the future! ❤️
5,🍭M🍭,"It’s very easy to use which is one of my needs. This app has a lot to offer! The editing is smooth, No annoying watermarks. Also, U can add your own music or sounds! This app is good but I have some suggestions, Maybe add more transitions and  filters. Also, Maybe add something where u can see what your layers look like. But overall this app is amazing!"
5,ASHabeca,"HOLY BUCKETS! This is the best editing app ever! (Other then after effects,) but anyway, ITS AWSOME. it’s easy, simple for beginners, and the effects or *mwah* but…… After the new update, about a month ago, you added lots of stuff. Like let’s say u kinda copied video star and after effects. Really? You copied video star, like let’s say the neon electric border. Looks similar right? Are u jealous of video star? It’s seems pretty much like that…."
4,evietheeditor,"I love CapCut, not only that it is easy to use, but it’s free with tons of effects. Ive made 3 edits in ONE DAY and there the best yet, out of my basic kine master edits. But’ ShortCut isn’t the best. Before downloading hear this: this is not hate review. And, this is only about ShortCut. It’s a free feature so I know it won’t be too high on point. But, when I try effects adding, it goes to 20% and says “unavailable”. Otherwise I tell you to download this app!"
4,niyaabanz,CapCut is a good app for beginners the more u learn off of it in the more you get the hang of stuff there’s also people do tutorials how to use it if you don’t know a lot of stuff about it if we’re just learning how to use it and a lot of stuff is mostly really good I just feel like sometimes people fix some stuff what is it that it’s a really good app and get it Ethan do a lot of stuff with it and even overlay stuff like two overlays and all of that!  Sincerely  Me-
5,CapCut User: Natalie,I’ve used capcut I think for four years but I have ALWAYS wondered why it doesn’t let me do certain things in style it always says “can not adjust current clip” and I’ve even tried to adjust the clip and still it did not work and your probably wondering what it’s for well it’s for the camera shake but still Great app!
5,cupcak 12345678910,What I like about this app is everything but as the title states I only have one request please add a feature that allows if you have audio that there could be a camera button that allows you to film like TikTok where it allows you to hear the audio when recording it would really help with A lot of my edits thank u and amazing app
3,ceristel,"So I used this app for a month and it was great at first! Then I went to go do another video and it said I had to do something in setting and I went into settings and I couldn’t find what needed to be done, I tried deleting the app and it didn’t work it still wanted me to change something in settings and as I said, I couldn’t find it. Fyi, it didn’t tell my to do something in setting when I first downloaded it. Please fix this or tell my what I have to do in settings"
5,kempesb246,"I was working on my song and I didn’t know how to do the lyrics for the lyrics video and I was like let me go check out some app to help me ou. Then I came across this app and I got to say it was the best decision that I made for my lyrics vid, at first it was a little complicated, but when you get used to it gets pretty easy that’s why I’m giving this app a five star review and I highly recommend it."
4,cool94628,So I’ve been using this app since the beginning of 2021. I can edit and use many features on my edits in January to May. But I’m not sure how this happened but there are less features on the sound effects and there are less category’s. I would love to get the more sound effects features and the more categories on the sound effects. Idk why there are less effects however.
4,Laicy18,I’ve only just started using editing apps and this was highly requested it’s very easy to use and understand lots of features completely free but if u had to add something it would be able to do more with the effects feature such as be able to move them around your photo or video and position them in a certain spot that would be a cool new feature.
2,payalandb,"CapCut is amazing and probably better than most free editing apps that don’t put watermark, it works great but after a few exports it has been ruining the quality of the videos that I have worked hours on by making it pixelated or glitchy after the export, people have been saying it was good until after the 3.4.2 version and they say if you don’t want bad quality then just download it from google but that doesn’t work since I’m on iOS so there’s no way my edits will look good now, I really had hope for this app :/"
4,abcdefgjagla,I don't usually write these but this app is awesome and so much easier and better for editing. On top of that no watermarks! The transitions are amazing there is so much I could say!!! But... Your only allowed to have 6 layers I'm a gacha editor and it's hard trying to tween with only 6 layers and this is the only app I could find that has easy tweeing (kine master and cute cut are goodbut laggy and hard) anyways if you could fix this then I will make 5 stars!!!
5,ygfhdfdhf,It’s really easy but I wish there could be more layers because on the app I used to use had a lot of layers but on the other hand it’s easier to use than other apps and I love that there is no watermark I can finally put my gacha/roblox/ text photo/layer/character/sentence in any spot with no struggle thank you so much for making this app and all the features but could use more!
4,elllll :)),"I loved being able to teach myself how to edit videos with this app since it was so easy for learning purposes. Now that I have the hang of it, it’s tons of fun. The only suggestion I have is to add a log-in and cloud future so we can use it across devices and keep old drafts (even if it was like a one-time payment or something). Would definitely invest a little to have that option!"
5,julygirl10lovenova,It’s an amazing app; so many options and things to do!! I do request if you could make it easier to overlay the animations. I would love if you added a feature like that because I personally would need it. I take up a lot of storage saving and putting more intro/outro animations. It would be really cool if you added more outro animation options too!
3,for capcut to see and fix,"I say the app is very good fore people including the new Auto Velocity update but i was working on editing for 1 hr and a half and i go get another overlay for a story and then im not on my project and i dont see it. It really took me long doing the overlays, captions/texts, text to speech, splitting, going through the video, etc. Im keeping what i was making personal but it was very hard and i managed yo make it 3 minutes and then bam. The project is gone 😢😭 Please fix i dont have motivation to make another"
4,ferdturd7162,"So the tutorial is not very helpful. My friends use this app as much as I use KineMaster, an AMAZING app to use along with this and PicsArt. I have no idea how to do ANYTHING on here except make “video covers”, which, mind you, don’t show up when I save them to my iPad. Adding music is VERY CONFUSING. VERY. Then again, I haven’t used to app in a while so I’m going to write another review tomorrow.             Love,             Luna 🏳️‍🌈👾💜🏐"
5,PandaPlays2000,"I love this app. It really is very easy. The only thing that could get improved is the chroma key, but that will probably never be perfect, since this is a free app. I’ve had this for years and never once had I had to watch a tutorial to make a project. It is compatible with Tik Tok which made it way better. I totally recommend this for light, quick, and easy editing."
5,Zarllie,"I love this app, but i also have some ideas for Capcut. you should make an option for the “Speed” called “Smooth” where when you slow it down it isn’t so glitchy. Also, can you add something where we can make velocity edits? I would love if you added some of the effects that “Video Star Pro” has but for free! I hope you read this, thank you!"
5,fox🦊gamer,I have used this to edit my animations for a year maybe more now and it’s really simple and great! The only down side is it may get slightly repetitive if you only use a set amount of effects so If you use this It would be good to experiment with all of them :) This app makes importing things like sound a breeze too so It’s definitely worth the download!
4,TyTy🖤💕,"I love the CapCut app but sometimes I forget exactly where I cut my video and I would like to be able to duplicate it when I need another copy for loops. Also at random times it tells me my storage is full I remove a lot of apps and pictures and it still says that it's full hopefully, something is not wrong with my phone. Other than that the app is great and I have no other problems with the CapCut app."
5,osmdJR,So I  got cap cut a while ago and I was new at the hole editing thing for TikTok I thought it would be so easy so I skipped The instructions how to use it and followed threw but if u don’t u may find it boring but read them and woah u fee like a pro for just a beginner u enter this world where you can edit move ur camera slow-MO and more! I can’t believe that cap cut took my rewind to a bad edit and mad it woah try CapCut it’s free!
4,makiya h,"Okay, So far CapCut is the Best Editing App I’ve Come Across. But the One Thing That has Made me upset is that they Took Away Styles. And I Had Never Got to Use it before, And I Really wanted to Try it out. But When I found out that they Took It away I was Upset, so all I’m Asking is to Bring back Styles and the Velocity Style as Well. But overall the App Is the Best. And You Don’t have to Pay for it. So for all the Beginners I Recommend You Download CapCut.😁"
1,please fix or help😕,"Ok so I’ve been loving this up for more then a year. It’s been overall amazing, until they added this update, or if it’s even an update, I don’t know. So I’m making a video which to the text I usually just have to copy it change what it says then move it.     Today, when I tried to it moved to another spot. I thought it just wasn’t working well so I restarted and even went to another project and tried it. It still didn’t work. This is a huge bug to me because I have to keep adjusting it which takes way more time to put it in the exact same spot for each text."
5,janazzzzz,Personally I have been looking for an app to use for my editing videos but I haven’t found one this good it’s an amazing app to use and to edit with I really enjoy this app there is a few changes that could be done just small changes but it’s still an amazing app to use I really enjoy using it and it’s way easier to use than any other app I tried
5,Asriel dreemor,"This app has all you need for editing and is absolutely free, it hasn't crashed on me once and it has audio editing too! Id recommend it even for beginner editors because its so easy to use! There's plenty of transitions, animations, and effects for audio! You can adjust clips and even edit the amount of contrast, shadows, hue, ect. I love this app and use it for all of my editing needs"
5,iJustDidThisForThe4Xeffect,I downloaded this app cause I saw someone’s edit on instagram and it was really good and they said that they used this app so I decided to try it out and to my surprise I can use all of the features on this app for free! I used to play for premium on another app but after seeing all that this app has to offer I have realized I am much better off using this app from now on!
5,myanimalsleeps,"Ok, overall the entire app is just,🔥. But I think it was the recent update that made me a bit sad about it. One of them i noticed had a maximum overlay restriction, and i needed more than 6 overlays to make my edit. It bugged me a bit and i’d like if you’d maybe put it back the way it was before? Thank you if you saw this and put it into consideration."
4,Xander Estrella,"I love the app, easy to use, easy to edit, and easy to post from one platform to another. But the thing is just sense there’s a new update about now having your favorited TikTok sounds to be connected to CapCut, it’s not really working for me ☹️. Even if I have wifi or not it’ll still not work and publish my favorited sounds on it. If you can try to fix it then okay, if you can’t then it’s okay."
5,nugget ♡,"The App is great! I think it includes everything necessary to make the perfect edits! Only one thing.. THEY REMOVED THE STYLE BUTTON!! I really enjoyed that button because it gave me the the option to do the 3d effect and AUTO VELOCITY!! Of course there were other quirks too but those were my favorite! Please Please Pleaseeee add it back!! Other than that, I highly recommend CapCut!!"
1,Gundriver,"It doesnt really matter how many features you have. It doesn't really matter that it’s absolutely, no catches free!! What matters is if the average person with NO video or photo editing experience can actually pick it up and use it.  There are absolutely NO instructions. There is not a single walkthrough.   “HEY!! Here is a free app for you! Hope you enjoy it! OH! By the way! Have fun figuring out how to use it on your own!”  The developers released this app completely under the assumption that you already know how to edit photo and video! It is an insult to guys like myself that know little to nothing about  this stuff."
5,Peazwing,"One app that does it most and it’s free  The most amazing thing you don’t have to worry and fuss about last minute repairs to your videos, right from your Smartphone in your hands CapCut gives you the best opportunity to look professional and creative with simple clicks just speed sometime and it’s surely will surely be wonderful and worthy and did I mention it’s free"
5,puppykutten-lover,"I love this app, so much! It is an amazing editing app, yet I have some suggestions. Today I accidentally deleted something that I didn’t export. I am here to request a ‘ Deleted ‘ spot where you can find all your deleted works. Here you can recover and delete forever. I would also like to request an unlimited amount of overlays. Thank you!"
4,Skandinavia Bret,I really love cap cut I am a beginning editor and it is so easy to use I absolutely love it my problem is u can’t move footage to another part for instance if u are doing an overlay and u want to move the footage u can’t it does not have that feature and it does need quite a few more sound effects before u listen to anything bad about Cap Cut just try it plus it’s free😊
5,mdpeattie,"Hello, I’m going to start off saying I love CapCut. But, there’s a small issue with it. I usually make Starstable related videos and wanted some hoof sound effects for a cantering horse. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any. All there was, was a whinny and a horse pulling a cart, which sounds like a trot. If you could add some more horse sound effects, it would be VERY helpful! Thank you for reading, goodbye!"
4,roxtox,"I’ve been using CapCut for 2 months and I’ve decided to tell this issue. I make gacha videos, so I put a lot of screenshots in, but whenever I make the video screenshot smaller,it kicks me out or would be really laggy. I know you have a lot of work to do but when your done, please try to read this and try to do something about the lagging. (Hope you have a great day! :D)"
4,lama🤍,So all works good EXCEPT for overlay and sticker. My screen is not glitching I turned my phone off 3 times and re-download CapCut 5 times. I tried pressing the sticker or overlay option but NONE work. It would be amazing if you update this. All good just some options doesn’t work. I have been experiencing this for 2 days and it’s still not working. I like making edits for kpop and now my FAVOURITE app is now not working. Thank you
5,Sunflower🌼🌼🌻,"Thais app is amazing and I love it and I make videos where I have to take screenshots and sometimes the screenshots don’t line up and then it looks weird and so I tested something and it didn’t work so, if you cropped a photo and you copied it then replaced it with a different photo could it also be cropped the same way as the other photos  Thanks , this would really help"
5,someone took my name ugh,"It’s great for a free app. The best part is no ads, no money to spend on it. I don’t use the text presets but they are beyond cool. Perfect for making edits, and your own videos. My only problem is that when I try to put an overlay of a png it makes the background black. I tried to add a video with a transparent background but it didn’t work. Saddest part was it was a png i animated for an hour"
5,jS@nh,"I love this app so much. I can’t believe everything is completely FREE! Such as animation, effects, transition and more!🤯 We don’t have to pay for VIP or Membership , unlike others editing app😐.I recommend you to download it because it’s really easy to use ,especially if you’re new to editing.  Whoever created this app they’re genius 😏 And Thank You for reading this. ❤️"
5,JimmyTee2,Almost every time I want to make a video on there it’s always saying I have full storage and it’s not my device it’s the app! Because I keep deleting photos from my photos gallery over and over again and it tells me the same thing! It’s just so annoying to the point we’re I hate the app like that much.
5,the k to the k,I love the app but I have some suggestions can you blur out cuss words in songs because I don’t wanna hear them and can you make a thing to edit songs like make is slow or fast if your already add that can you show me because if any of you know how to show me please oh and can you add a thing for moving stuff and suggesting them.
5,editlover10000,"I usually don’t leave reviews on apps, but I just feel like this app needed some recognition. It is super easy to use, and makes it look so smooth when you are done editing your videos. I have many countless edits on this app and all have turned out absolutely magnificent. It works if you are a beginner or a professional and ITS FREE. I completely recommend this app 10/10."
5,YSUSYSHSBS,"So i made something that took 2 hours to make and it doesn't save, i thought it had something to do with my storage but i deleted all my photos and videos and it still didnt save. And I also deleted my project except the one i was working on. And then to make sure it wasnt my storage so i made a new project put a random picture and it still didn't save!"
2,Sugey 💗,"So this app is AMAZING don't get me wrong. I've been having this app for abt 2-3 months now and all of a sudden it doesn't work. It doesn't let me do anything except add audio and multiple videos and photos. Doesn't let me do overlays, stickers, text, and the other things you can do. It's really devastating and I honestly really need it to edit. I've tried deleting it and reinstalling it, closing it and opening it, and even power off my phone. Idk if it's my phone or it's capcut. But please fix whatever's going on. Please and thank u<3  -Sugey ❤️"
4,my user is rosygalll,"I’ve been using capcut for a while now, and this never happened to me. But every time I import a sounds it doesn’t import. I’ve got out and got back in and stuff but it just says “add audio” even if I already did. I deleted it and made a new one still didn’t work. It’s being really annoying now. It’s been happening too long. Fix this, it may happen to others."
5,horselover🥳,"So i used to love using this app and i got really great at it, but recently i havent been able to load anything on there. It keeps saying “no internet connection” and its getting frustrating. Ive tried everything and it never works. I dont know if its my phone or the app, but please see if you can fix it!!"
5,jlong426,"Okay i use CapCut for RBLX edits or something but like I want better motion. Like when u press the diamond thing and move it like slowly, it goes like fast. I would like CapCut to fix that. I also have som suggestions. Like when u have a overlay, there could be a button that says “glow” and adjust it so how much it would glow. And u could also select the color of the glow. Thanks!"
4,picklesarebetterthanyou,"I love CapCut!! It’s easy to make edits and everything makes sense, but whenever I try to use a green screen, it leaves little green spots around it, which is a little frustrating. I thing there should be a few more effect ideas. Also, when I try to make a slow edit, the quality is not great, so I think you guys should probably fix that. But other than these few things, I love this app!"
4,dododolalalla,"When I opened CapCut there was no edits so then I feedback CapCut. I went into CapCut again and it was fixed but when I clicked the + button it’s said I needed to do this. So I pressed confirm. As normal it takes me to settings then after that I clicked CapCut but I didn’t see where you save videos. So, I deleted CapCut and reinstalled after I clicked the + button but still it says I have to save my videos. I regret delete CapCut. :("
5,Kyscraper,"By far the best video editing app out there. I have used so many video editing apps, but this one is top notch in every way. I own a videography business and this is what I use when I’m traveling and want to make professional level videos on the go. Very easy to use and downloads so much faster than other editing apps. Highly recommend."
5,JimmyTheLord,"Im a teen without a job to get money, and it you think my parents will pay for a monthly subscription to a video editor then think again. As a small youtuber, this app has genuinely helped me edit videos without worry of a subscription. Thank you capcut! Keep telling us to keep our money in our pockets!"
5,NubyXDSK,"This app is pretty good for making simple video edits, up to professional video edits once you fully learn how to use it, but i was wondering if you could add a fit to cropped video feature, where the backround would be sized the same as the video that was edited and cropped. Overall great app though, I would recommend!"
5,Gemgirl_5,It’s so much easier to edit with and it has so many cool features. In some editing apps it doesn’t even give you music. Well no more. CapCut gives you so many songs to choose from which are really good. I used to use another editing app and there was no music options. It wasn’t that good either. You should give CapCut a five star rating
4,inkgir,"This app is amazing and all but the problem is that every time I want to make a video it keeps telling me to clean my storage and it really annoys me to the fact that I have to delete my hard work just because of my storage and I tried to delete some of the hand videos I didn’t want In my photos app but it still shows that, and I really want you to fix it"
4,Avverry,"I love this app with all my heart but I have come across a problem. When I make an edit, on the app it looks amazing, but when I export it to my camera roll. The transitions (animations) are super choppy and some of them don’t even look like the original transitions I put on. It is a super great app and it looks amazing within the app but in your camera roll it looks bad :( hopefully you could get that fixed it would be great! :)"
5,Polina Aronova,I don't use use the app to make edits but i use it to make slowmos! They always come out super smooth when you put the resolution on 2/4k and the frame rate to 60! I recommend this app if someone is looking to make really smooth slowmos without needing video star pro or after effects. I with they added a twixtor effect so it was even better but overall an amazing app!
5,Ashley plays games to review,"This is an awesome app! I do things with it all the time, such as animating and things like that! This app is also pretty easy to use and I highly recommend it! By the way, there’s this problem where the audio, but I’m using the microphone on the app, the audio comes really low volume, I’m not sure if it’s because it’s my iPad or it’s the app, so yeah, I have nothing more to say, have a nice day!"
4,gabby blair,"The app is amazing!, I use it to edit all my roblox TikTok videos. I stopped editing for about a month and I come back to the app to edit a new video but for some reason it wont let me press any buttons at the bottom if that makes any sense. For example the Format button it wont let me press it. I’ve already reset the app and just incase I even deleted the app and re downloaded it. I’m not sure whats going on but yea."
4,number one fan in the world,"I love this app so much! It makes editing a lot easier and I love the multitude of editing options I can choose from, except the videos I can make are limited by length. The longer the video gets the more laggy it gets and which makes it harder to edit. All the tools are amazing but I feel the length of which the video that can be made using the app needs improvement."
5,Moldy egg,"Bruh CapCut is literally to the death of me, first no ads!!!! Second, everything is like free and the transitions omg 💀💀💀 I love them so much. (the animation ones haha)  CapCut is feeding us well with these amazing animations. I use this app with cute cut pro, and it just works so well. There’s also no watermark which is a big thing. I am so glad I came across this app. I will be using this app for edits later on 🧍‍♀️"
5,lulu_6685,Did capcut update its slow motion thing? I seen a tik tok that said capcut updated it’s slow motion to be smoother? Also if it did how come mine hasn’t updated yet. I always have to delete capcut and other apps because of my storage and I reinstall it when making videos. So if it did update could u tell me why mine hasn’t updated yet? 😟 I’m on a iPhone 6s Plus 💀
4,Itz_StrawberryaEDM,"When I add an overlay and have the green screen be removed when I press the remove background button it either takes out the entire thing or only bits so I don’t know if you can do this but can you choose where people want the background to be removed like choose what part they want removed, other than all that this is one of the best editing apps I have ever had in my life"
5,@navi_mariee on ig <3,"I’m so so pleased with this app it has so many diverse free effects that you can use for any type of video you’re editing whether it be for a fan account, for school, etc. There’s no video limit like with other editing apps. It’s a little difficult to get the hang of at first but once you do it’s amazing! 10/10 highly recommend :)"
5,anarts,I am in love with everything about this app. It makes content creation for Instagram reels and TikTok so much easier and with more than just the basic editing tools one needs but super super easy to understand and use. It definitely makes a difference and I always use it for editing my videos. Thank you guys so much for such an amazing app.
3,ahhsjeifkdbsilqpqplsal,"I love this app, it’s grate for beginners and maybe even for pro editors, I love the graphics! And the effects are nice! But it always says my storage is full and that I can’t download the app, I press the download button like usual when you wanna download a app again after you deleted it, But when I press it it will not download, this has never happened before, and my storage is not full, I can not update my phone (idk why) but please fix this"
5,Pennywise .__.,"I used to hate editing videos for my video production and editing class. I was using kapwing and wevideo and it was so difficult to edit stuff, and it was glitchy and things weren’t adding my clips in right, until I met cap cut and this app is easy,I get it very,it has no lag, and you can make some really cool videos, so thank you Cap cut,because now I love editing videos and it’s not a nightmare."
1,very frustrating and upsetting,I love this app and it is great to use but I just spent the last 4 1/2 hours editing this video and it turned out great. I left the app and I went back in to show one of my friends and it won’t let me play it at all. I tried everything I restarted the app and my phone but no luck and it feels as if it is just gone because when I press on it it takes me to as if I am about to edit and it is a blank screen and I can’t even hit the back button. I’m so upset Because I worked so hard on that video. So I suggest not putting to much effort in to it apparently.
4,LucasDash,"This app was actually really helpful! I joined a 30k follower esports team as an editor! I did it, working on montages everyday. Then one day, it stopped working. So my first thing I tried doing was deleting it and then downloading it back. I did that,and then the same thing happened! I checked for updates, no updates. Now I can’t use any effects,texts,or speed or anything else. Please respond"
5,rfjsnnnsnnnnnnnnnnn,"I have just one thing, I think you should be able to add like animations and transitions because sometimes I will be using an animation that’s at the very back and I don’t wanna apply to all but also don’t wanna have to scroll to the very very back ya know? But otherwise this app is amazing I love it it is very similar to vita but this is definitely better for edits"
5,5hy5onger,Ok so I’m a gacha tuber and I use this on all my memes. I love the effects and transitions. It makes my videos much better quality.  The only bad thing is that sometimes it won’t let me add images but I just have to delete the tab and re open the app and it’ll be normal again. It’s only a small glitch with an easy solution so I don’t mind it.   So yeah I recommend the app and I love it.
5,tHetruthHurtsOFreviews,"This app is the BEST editing, it has every sticker you’d want, any transition, anything!! It can be hard at first because you don’t know what to do or how to do it, but once you get to know it’s literally awesome! And.. it has no watermark! Every app I had was horrible because I couldn’t afford their price, and it’s free which makes it awesome, so you can be happy and don’t waste money!!"
4,thefruitybestfriend,"So, I overall like the app and it’s the easiest to use out of all the ones I’ve used. Although, there are some things that should be improved. 1# video quality: when I put a video in, it looks choppy when I’m editing (and after) but when I look at the video before it was edited, it’s super clear. I’m not sure what happened but this is an ongoing problem for me. Please fix this!"
5,IsabellaMeMe,"Ok, so when I downloaded this app it was amazing! Until I experienced a laggy, robotic sounding voiceover. I am trying to make a story, but it won’t sound right. So, I hope you get this message and fix this one little bug! Thank you for listening!"
3,capria parker,"Hello, this is the reason why I give 3 stars. I love the app I use it for my videos but the songs has cuss words and some of the thumbnails shows inappropriate content. I can’t choose the music, and the problem that it lags when I go in the app for 1 or 2 hours. May you please fix that? And can you put music that’s friendly and for kids, and the thumbnail is appropriate. Otherwise I still recommend this app."
5,knuckchoublaugh,"I’m no professional by any means, but for an app that gives you full editing power and can export quality videos, its outstanding.   Then there’s the fact that it doesn’t gouge you for money at any point during the process. I love companies that make incredible stiff like this, I’m just glad I found this one. Hope everyone else loves it too"
5,hannahthehero🦋🦄,"If your on mobile or PC, I totally recommend this app. I use it to make roblox edits and it’s so EASY to use! They have really good transitions, good effects, and if you like to make anime edits I recommend this app also. I don’t think I have any recommendations for it though. But yeah if your thinking of getting the app I totally recommend it, I’m still new to editing so this app really helps me! PEACE ✨💖😍🥰✨"
5,E E E E EE E E E,CapCut is a really simple and not at all difficult app it is so easy if you find this hard then you need are literally beneath the age of five this is literally so easy to do and if your clips are all messed up CapCut a literally let you put them in order add music or put filters I love this up and no other app could literally beat this or video tutorial
4,anime_lover2250,I think the creators of cap cut should add a feature that makes it easyier to edit how long stuff stays on screen like there should be a way  to edit them all like you want them all at 0.5 seconds there should be a way to do that all at once so you have to do them all by them self witch takes forever and this would greatly improve the app in my option
3,Usermer,"You see, CapCut is an amazing editing app. I don’t know whether or not it’s on my part but the editing screen is too small. Some of the animations are malfunctioning. I delete texts and when I rewrite things, there still there, even though theres no indication of it ever being there. It just has some tweaks and stuff. Not too big of a deal, but since I use it pretty often, it’s has gotten quite hard to use. That is all for now."
5,Fiona_Fabulous,"I love this app so many transitions, options for effects and more! Just one minor issue is when I insert a sticker it doesn’t want to do the animation I gave it. For example I wanted it to fade it but when I exited the editor it never faded it it just popped up like I had done no animation on it. Please fix this bug because I am getting a little bit frustrated!"
3,~Wolfie~ Hello!,"Hello capcut! This app has improved so much and I have used it for pretty long now, but one thing really bothers me, when I try to click edit and then speed (for the audio) it is blacked out and I can’t use it, and I need to use it for a bunch of my edits, so if you could please stop that “darkening out” so I can actually use it. Thank you so much! It would help a lot and is a must have for me. (Yes, I have already tried searching it up but no results.) thank you."
5,yyvvuuag is my roblox account,"I love the app but it has one flaw that i just got yesterday and it still is happening. So basically when i use like the sunset effect number 1 it makes weird black flashes after it’s exported. I hope it gets fixed because I really need to have good looking vids for edits.  Don’t Rush on the Bug but just do your best ^^   Sincerely, anonymous user"
5,myah3000,"i’m not even gonna lie i love this app so much. ever since i’ve started using it i’ve oddly been more productive and my edits have came out better. i haven’t even been using the transitions either (which are amazing and not the ones you see in every other app). there’s so many features that are fun to play around with and i find myself doing something different every time!   two suggestions, i would love if we could import our own fonts!!! i love the ones that are there but i would like more variety. also, i wish we could adjust the opacity/intensity of the effects!!   the fact that this app is free though? thank you so much!!! i love it"
4,°°.°°,"How come we can’t search the song that we’re looking for? Are you picking out other songs so we don’t play something inappropriate? We’ve all heard some disturbing things before. I would give this 5 stars but this is just annoying, why do we have to pick songs that are already picked for us when we can search them up ourselves?"
5,Albert Stien,"Found it from a video on Tik Tok, just the app I’ve been looking for.  I think it should have a mode where you can move the edited faces (Like Dark Side sticker) around so you can have it attached to one person at a time, and have it where the face isn’t always crooked, other than that the app’s perfect"
5,IS YOUR MOM BOII,"heyo! me again. I love capcut so much. whenever you do a update again this is just a suggestion. maybe on the in and out animations you could add a way so people could add the animation to all clips/texts. I personally love to make text overlays with songs, and I know other people do as well and this would make it go by easier + faster! :)"
4,JustgotCapcut,"I just got this app and I’m already in love with it! I love all the stickers and awesome effects! But one little problem… When I checked my iCloud storage, I have so much storage/space! But when I go into CapCut, it says I don’t have any space to make a video! I only made one short video and it won’t let me make a second one. Can you please maybe fix that if you have time or can? I’m sorry if It sounds rude."
4,Kacchan... we were 5,"I really love using this app for my tiktoks, but i think you should add a favorite section to the animations so you dont have to keep going back and forth. Something else i think you should do is making a video about all the tips and tricks about the app like how do i make a overlay ect ect, yet again this is a suggestion so you dont have to do it but you can if you want! Thank you if you read this."
5,Adriannagetwith,Capcut is an AMAZING editing app. I definitely suggest it! I have one suggestion which is maybe have something to check if the music is copyrighted or not Please and Thank you! I also want to say Capcut takes a lot of storage up and battery so please move some things around and that’s pretty much it! I hope the Developers read this it would be a pleasure! 4/5 ✨👏🏽
5,weridgirlgigi,"I love this app, I make anime edits on it’s because I’m a nerd. It has amazing features and one of the best mobile editing apps, but there’s just one thing. Keyframes. Keyframes would really helps so you can make text from right up to the screen to in the middle, the way you want it. And yes I know there’s a filter but I would still really help. Overall I love it."
4,•.°2.0°.•,"I love this app, its free, has no watermark, ready to use sounds, but its very slow. It takes at least 20 seconds to open a wip. I press the video and 20 seconds later it opens. It may just be my phone, but i doubt it. My phone has never lagged, and still hasnt to this day, so im guessing its the app. But who knows? Not me, obviously. Other than that, i love the app, and i just think thats the only problem i have with it."
4,Katelin Lindsey,"okay, so I’ve been using this app for a few months now. I absolutely love it and my yt videos are better because of this app  But.. there’s been a problem lately to where I can’t use overlays or any effects.. I’ve tried rebooting my iPad and going back, then deleting the app. Once I got the app back I still had the same problem  Same with sound effects  Overall amazing app"
4,ZeeZeegotu(once again),"It’s pretty great and all, but it stopped working after a while. I can’t overlay or put text anymore and I tried on multiple projects. I’m not sure if it’s the layers it something, but it just wouldn’t work. I have spent hours trying to get it to work reinstalling it multiple times. It just won’t work. I can’t put filters anymore either. Basically if I touch the overlay button my phone crashes. FIX THIS NOW"
4,apilonia,"Hello cap-cut creators! Capcut is a great app and very fun to edit with! But i keep on getting bugs! And capcut keeps crashing and it won’t let me play the video i made. Can you please fix this? I don’t know if it’s my internet or capcut, but I’m pretty sure it’s capcut. If you could fix it that would be great. Thanks! Otherwise capcut is a great editing app and I’ve made hundreds of edits with this app. Definitely would recommend to download it."
5,rose.solomon,"So capcut is one of the best editing app and it is easy to use just one problem everytime I try to add animation and press the effects i want there will be a pop up saying "" connect to the wifi or check ur connection"" but the thing is i am connected to the wifi and im the only one who uses it its been two days since this has happened...."
3,Willow😭😭😭,"It was a very good app until it started bugging out. Now whenever I try to use transitions, it says I have internet connection issues. I’ve tried everything to fix it, but nothing worked. I checked my connection, updated the app, deleted and reinstalled it, but I’m still getting that error. The app is also really laggy, and that makes tweening and animating nearly impossible. It definitely needs work."
1,multi-fandomteen,"The first month i had it, it worked great. Then i had to make an edit a bit longer than what I normally do. I filled up my storage too much so I cleared it out. Then I couldn’t even view my edits, so i left it alone for about an hour. Why have all my edits been deleted?!?! I deleted them from my camera to “clear up storage” even though my phone was using even less storage than usual. Now i have no way of accessing my edits. I had a total of five, deleted. What. Happened  Edit: i got my edits back but it still says im using too much storage. I am using less than usual!"
4,a simple owl lover.,"I personally love CapCut, it’s really easy to use so I like it above any other editing apps I’ve tried. But, at one point I needed to delete the app since I was running low on storage, but now I can’t download it anymore. I have enough storage and it shows up when I search it, but whenever I hit the download button, nothing happens. Does anyone know how to fix this issue?"
5,CaydenWasTaken,"Audio needs more attention adding audio from files would make this 11/10 just thats the one things this app is missing in my opinion 😕 still a great and easy to use app for editing tho, have made things on cap cut that would I feel like have taken months as a professional editor 😎"
4,Gamergirl968924884,"If I’m being completely honest this is the best editing/video app in opinion, you can add your own sound,there’s stickers,backgrounds,and much more but the only problem is that when I try to export my video it says “not enough storage free up some storage to continue “ even when I have enough storage for about 20 videos, but overall this is a great app!"
5,gabe vvvbbvfbbn,Ok so I found this looking for a video editor in the App Store and it didn’t look cool but I also wanted a video editing app where you remove the background without a green screen so when I realized you could do that I got it then I saw how it had multiple effects and filters and now I love it! If I could I would give this app an infinity star rating!
2,Allge,"It is an excellent application, easy to use, but it has made me uninstall applications and other files, emptying the phone's RAM memory and I always received a message saying that I did not have space to edit a video.  Also, when I want to apply sound effects, the app sends me a message that I have no internet signal ... But as if I have internet at home, I also have unlimited internet on my phone.  Simply put, uninstall the app because it doesn't work right.  So here I leave my testimony and judge for yourself ..."
4,camila😏✨😜,"Ok so, I love and enjoy CapCut very very much I really think video star is confusing. And this is way easier . But when you guys made the new “update” when I try to click on my usual effects (and this problem is only on the effects) it says “no internet connection please try again later” and it only happens to the ones that I need."
5,Yamaj on YT,Hey! You app has everything I need to edit anything but the only problem I have with the app is the fact that I can’t keyframe my text so I can animate it to move across the screen to my liking. If you guys could add that feature that would be amazing and that would literally make this app the #1 editing app on every mobile platform🔥🤘
5,tidhdbd,"i really love capcut and it has all the transitions needed its like having Videostar but having it on all platform!!, you have all the special transactions and, effects i love them they are so nice to use, 😁😁 i love that it doesn’t take much time to upload your video, so many awesome types of things you can do on that app thank you so much Capcut for editing my videos!! 💋"
5,Yasmin2006fonseca,"First of all, its free. I’ve been wanting to edit things so beautifully but i cant afford paying anything for apps and all that. I downloaded it today and omg! I learned almost everything abt it, it has all featured paid apps like video star has, and its so simple! I want to congratulate everyone who made this app! It honestly saved my quarentine lol. Keep up with all that good work! 💕"
5,wwrytessdddfhgcse,This app is completely free and doesn’t make you put a watermark on your videos unless you choose to. It has so many cool tools and everything I want in a editing app. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Also they may not have all the songs you want but you can fix that if you have IOS and screen recording a sound and imputing it to your edit.
4,SofiePixels,"I’ve been using CapCut for awhile now, but recently it hasn’t been letting me change the opacity in the text boxes. I would love for that to be fixed, but everything else it perfect! It’s free, easy to use, and won’t put a CapCut watermark (unless they made the edit) on your video! I love making edits with this app! Definitely my favorite, but I still would love for people to fix the text box’s opacity issue :)"
5,bbsyncx,"Love this app for editing! only problem is that now when i used the overlay feature and removed the background, it took out much more than just the green screen. This is happening in videos which i have removed the background of before, but have been just fine."
3,trangnd000,"I live in the USA and try to create some videos by using the free template from my home country. Since I updated a new version, i cannot use it anymore even though I had tried to use vpn to switch my network to another country. I love capcut because it helps me to make a lots of interesting videos, but now I cannot create more video due to that reason. Hopefully Capcut can reconsider and let more customers from another country use it."
4,Blaccer,"i love this app, it’s so easy to use! however, whenever i use the keyframe feature, it always zooms in on the video when i don’t want it to. i want the keyframes to go side to side, and it’s just not working. also, i think you should add more text features to make it more updated and easy to use. but overall, it’s an AMAZING app and i definitely recommend downloading it."
3,hiagchig,"So for my first 2 edits I was able to extract sounds from my favorites list on TikTok however on my 3rd one where I usually find my favorites it say to connect there is no internet however I have the wifi connected cause everything else is working fines I don’t see the problem I’ve also tried opening and closing the app multiple times, this is the only reason I give it 3 stars, otherwise it’s an amazing app and I love to use it."
5,hsvejsvdhsjdbdghr,Hi I been on CapCut for a long time when I just got this I was so happy to be able to edit better but when I got on I was sad cuz I could only put 16 or less pics so it can go in my photos the thing and some edits are too short so I’m asking to make the edits longer and let ur users add more photos
5,Colby fan🥺🤫,"i love it, everything is amazing about it. but my iphone 6s cannot handle everything i do on there. i have had to delete so many projects of either my phone being slow or capcut just messing up. me personally, i think capcut is an edit app where everyone can make sick edits! it just doesn’t have all the things that videostar pro has or something. but everything is like free on there. also sometimes i put like tiktok videos in capcut so if i ever run out of wifi or like my sim goes out or something (i can’t remember the name.) i’ll be able to watch some tiktoks on there. honestly i recommend it.   hope this helps!!!"
4,♥️♥️Gachalifelover2♥️♥️,"I freaking love this app 9/10 the only thing i would change is that when selecting things to edit you swipe over them to add them not tap that little bubble in the corner it takes forever to add it takes me a good 6 minutes adding a 100 screenshot video, mostly because I click exit on accident or I keep missing the bubble. Other than that I love the app!"
3,Natania Feinberg,I used this app for awhile now it worked good you know no problems until today. I ran out of storage on CapCut so I deleted it all and then it told me “CapCut Requires access to the album for editing and saving videos” so I clicked next and it took me to settings and there was no option to let me give it access so I reinstalled the app hoping it would work and no same problem I think this is just a glitch but please fix this or help me.
5,DianaTweets,"Basically, I have been using CapCut for a while and it is going well. Except I had used so much storage and CapCut told me that I don’t have enough memory. I deleted so many memories and still, No storage space. I deleted so many videos and pictures and still no storage!! I also deleted many apps too. So many memories, Wasted!"
4,The G Force Kids,"Okay so, I've had this app for 4 months now. ITS WONDERFUL!.. But.. I had to delete and re-download the app, because it was lagging really bad, and I forgot how to let it access my photos 😒🙄. I just have a suggestion of when you first download the app, it can access the photos with just an “allow” or “don’t allow” button. I know this may sound dumb, but, PLEASE!  Thank you for making such a wonderful app,   -Phoebe"
5,Genshingamer,"Overall this app is really impressive when it comes to video making and editing. It is super useful, and it gives you all types of options! It is so fun to use. You can get super creative with this, although I don’t recommend it for animation. But other than that it is really good to use! ❤️"
5,capcutttttttt,"i download this app just added some thing for the end of the year, it has improved my editing so much on this app I totally recommend it. I also love that you can take away the watermarks not like any other editing app which I love so much I can edit anything like pictures of family which I completely like."
5,JoneIIe,"Making slow motion a little more smoother. When changing the speed to make videos slower, it literally goes frame by frame to slow it down which is quite annoying to me sometimes but I think it would be better to make it smoother. If that’s not in your league then its completely fine."
5,karah bara,"No matter what, it won’t let me do basic transitions, effects, etc. because I “don’t have internet connection” and I DO! Sorry if I’m being rude but, I HAVE 3 BARS OF WIFI AND UNLIMITED DATA!!!! Again, sorry if this came off as rude, it wasn’t meant to be, but I hope I’ll hear back soon so I can continue editing!   Sincerely, you customer, Karah Dorothy Hamling"
4,oniononions,"It’s prob one of the best editing apps I’ve used on my phone, mostly because there isn’t a watermark!! But I would suggest some things to make it a bit better. I really wish there was graphs with the keyframes. I also kinda wish the slow motion wasn’t so glitchy (or it might just be my phone who knows). I don’t really know what else to say but over all I rlly like this app!!"
5,dnduzbsj,"I love this app! It’s totally FREE, there’s transitions, and you could add music!! You could also do affect sounds! It even has a very easy tutorial on how to use it! you could edit pictures and videos!! I use this app all the time to express myself! I never thought there was a app as good as this app!! I love This app and I think it should have a 5 star rating."
5,4DXB,"I’ve mixed videos together for literally decades. I can’t believe how easy this is to use to create fun videos. Get this app. Now. Why are you still reading?   I wish it was easier to add my music. I have some music in folders other than iTunes and it’s virtually impossible to add. I’ve figured a workaround, but this would be a nice enhancement.   Great job!"
5,✨✌️coco✌️✨,It’s good I use it all the time but now I can’t because my storage was full for it and I deleted photos and apps and it still doesn’t work and I have little bit of apps left and I don’t wanna delete it. Number 2 can you guys add more layers so we can do more please it would help a lot.
5,HadeerLeila,"Hello! I love this app so much! It’s super helpful, but my only worry is if it looks on your photos. I cant let it look in my photos because i wear a hijab and when you click “select photos” when you first install the app it doesn’t let you add any other photos after the ones you just picked. I need this immediately answered!!"
4,lokddkk,"I really love CapCut. The app is really easy to navigate & you get use to using to the different tools pretty fast. My only thing that I wish could be different is the censor sticker. Could you make it smaller so that it wouldn’t take up so much space on the screen. If you were to change this, I could give CapCut a 5/5 stars, because other than this the app is really good."
5,alpha_ziegler,I’m an Instagram editor and the thing I want is being able to change brightness on keyframes so it looks like the video star flash Like I really want that so if you could plz add that ability to the app it would be literally perfect and you cannot chroma key after doing it for like 3 times so if you could fix that I’d be thankful ❤️
5,ms.swirl only on yt,so basically I wanna be a roblox editor and this is what I need it has the perfect effects and it had the effect I have been looking for.  I love this app whoever thinks it’s bad is seeing things.  This app has all the effects everyone needs.  You should download it.  It’s worth it trust me they have velocity and much more special effects for your videos.
2,nan yee,"Do you know how you can write sentences and put them on your video? I tried that! But there’s sort of one problem that keeps irritating me and it is a nuisance. No offense but it is true, and what I see here is becoming a problem as it already is. It doesn’t show up on my screen when I make the video. I tried fixing it and it does but when I do it the second time it doesn’t show up. If you don’t know where this is going I can prove it to you on social media."
3,DaWeeb4Life,"Hello Capcut! I am informing you about the problem with no style button. Its odd because I just had this option like just last week and now it isn’t there?😂 I believe its just a lag in capcut but I would like to see it soon as possible. Please help. Overall your app is a great platform for editors and its very fun to create edits on your platform. But please, do fix the style option problem. Its creates stress for people who want to make edits (including me)❤️"
3,Trenzin Zuthul,"I love this app so much and I make all of my edits on here, but one thing that makes my edits so much better, is the styles option. A lot of my edits on CapCut are Velocity and I’m not good at manually doing velocity so I normally use auto velocity, but when I got my clips ready, I got confused when I couldn’t find the styles option? I just think many people on CapCut will agree and I would like to think I speak for every user of this app. Especially on tiktok too"
5,FIN the WOMEN,"This game is fine I can make all my videos on it and it’s smooth, high quality, and has great options. I just don’t get those one star views and when I read them it’s all about bugs 🤷‍♀️ it’s not really the apps you just probably got a virus cause it works smoothly. So it works great nice editing just don’t get the one ⭐️"
4,Jacob😄,"Love this app, it has all the features you could dream of and doesn’t shove adds or subscriptions in your face.  There is one bug i come across frequently though, it says “No internet connection” when I try to load my saved tiktok sounds. It requires me ti delete and reinstall to get the feature working. Other than that the app is perfect."
4,gbsgdhvdvrjj,I mean it is really easy to use for one. And it has a lot of great features too. In my oppinion it is a really good beginer app for editing. The only two things i complain about are the effects and velovity. The effects aren’t that bad but they could get improvenent. And for velocity is that it is really hard to do because if you like try to do it how it’s suppoesed to be it looks wierd but anthing else it pretty good! 100% recomend it!
5,Kiara_Cookies,"I rated this five stars so you would read this. Its really a 3 star because when I open this app it keeps saying its not connected to the internet but I am. So a lot of my features are gone. Over all, before this glitch I really loved it so thats what made me rate 3 stars. I uninstalled this app and I am going to try again.   This was a lovely app."
5,thegoodpuppy,It is a amazing editor where even the beginners can learn to use it. It has a lot of different editing options and I mean a lot but it misses same factors we would like in editor like manual background removing. Overall a amazing editor and I recommend it to anyone that has started editing or has been editing for a while!
4,UwU 👌👌👌,"As the title said, I love the app love everything about except that it takes up all my storage. The other thing is, it is so hard to animate things. I had to delete the app a few times because it took up to much space. My iPad doesn’t have a lot of storage so yeah. I also feel like it would be more popular if it didn’t take up a lot of storage.  Thank you for reading this"
5,L0w3rcaseboy,I personally love this app it always did what I always needed it to do advanced or simple the only problem I ever had with this app is that there’s no motion blur I love the new adding of the graphs but they shouldn’t add motion blur for them graphs would look more clean and professional but other than that 10 stars in my book!!!
4,emma31126493504,"I love CapCut so much but there is sometimes glitches. If I put text on my edit, after playing around with it for a little while the text will start having a mind of its own. Some text will appear before other words when I haven’t even placed it to be like that. When I try to fix it, it doesn’t work and I have to start over. This is why I give CapCut 4 out of 5 stars."
5,sophiaofficial,I love this app so so much it’s a big step ahead from IMovie. But I really don’t like that when I try to use shortcut it often glitches and never ever loads when I want to make a short. But other hen that I love it there are so many features and stickers and I love that I can color correct my videos. Next best thing to Adobe.
5,unicorn896111,This app is amazing I love capcut I make gacha vids and it’s preety good I love that it’s free no adds the effect are just the best and I’m actually glad it’s not that hard to use because I have experienced other apps that make you wnat to pay and it’s kinda hard for me to use thanks to cap cute I can post more vids and everything works smoothly for me!
5,Langga koh,"So, the app is great totally recommend to use this app to edit but one problem I know you need to update the app after a few months but when it tells me to I press it to make a update and it doesn’t work that well and it doesn’t update anything but after all totally recommend it works great"
3,Reindeergirl11,"As a small gachatuber, I loved this app. Up until the new update. The update added more facial features, which is pretty cool, but in gacha club, when I take screenshots, I have to squeeze them into seeing no black. CapCut was good for putting the screenshots in there and animating them. Then, today I was planning to make a video, and in CapCut, there was a black vortex on the edges in my opinion, this reduces the quality of the video. Please fix this.  P.S. yes, I did shrink the screenshots in."
4,lulu1!!!,"This app is really good for beginner editing! Honestly it’s a lovely app but, it takes up so much storage! Also, when I go to clear the stuff to get more storage I go back to the editor and it says insignificant storage! I go to setting to clear some stuff but it still won’t work! I hope you guys can fix that buggy! Overall, it’s a great app! There are a lot of music and filters etc.!"
2,unanimousjkhaha,"So, I am an action movie editor for a friend of mine and I make movies with action genres all the time too, so the gun effects were perfect for the action movies but can someone please tell me why they removed them. Creator I would take it as a humongous favor if you would help me if it is a big or please put the sound effects back in because we made a 30 minute long movie the other day and now, we don’t have any affects to put in the movie. So please do it or if it’s a bug please help me."
4,🌟toon⭐️,"This app is perfect for making edits, and I’ve been making a lot lately, however there is an issue with adding audio. I would click on the option to place in a sound from TikTok and it would say error loading, whether or not I’m offline or even connected to internet, can you please get that fixed please?"
5,xxlucylovesrobloxxx,"I personally think that this app is awesome as heck, but it may be confusing. Especially because I’m learning how to edit, it is very fun but this app makes it easier than other editing apps like IMovie and KineMaster. This app is the best ever, overall this is probably the best editing app EVER! If you are looking something easy, download this app right now.           -Fellow app user"
5,at cat hat dat i yummdmdu,"I been on cap-cut for a while I love all there effects and how you can add them to make them to make them look even look but I think l they should add more thing I think cap-cut should check out ae and video star but some stuff I think that should add is hex blur , better transitions , more effects , more overlays to choose from , cubes , triangles.. more shapes and better quality."
5,WulfieBean,"I love this app so much, and love the shortcut mode. It helps a lot for beginners like me. The only thing I think it really needs is an option to search up specific songs. I don’t have the money to add songs onto my phone and sometimes I wish there were a few more song choices. Other than that, I love this!"
5,itz gamer 123101,"See I use this app to make edits for my TikTok account. I love it it’s so easy to use. There is one thing though, you see I’m a very organized person and like to have thing in folders. It would be awesome if they added folders so you you wouldn’t have to go searching to find the edit. It would just be in a folder. But otherwise I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE APP!!"
3,GGAmongus,It’s really good but when I added pictures and made a massive edit for ME!!!It got deleted when I added new pictures for my kakeguri edit and I wish you can add some things like voice effects and like you can do how fast and how slow you want your effects but moving on with my edit I’m very good at this app and I don’t want to find another app because those are so HARD TO USE!!Just fix that bug because it’s happening a lot
5,Royale_Wolfie,"I’ve used a lot of great editing apps, but this one is best out of all of them! It had NO WATERMARK, amazing effects, and very simple to use! Now you got to admit if you use this app, it’s pretty great! My videos I make have improved a lot, and by a lot I mean a lot! I had to give it a five star rating! It’s really good for YouTubers! So I promise everyone will love this amazing editing app!"
5,CiiciReviews,Better Than any Other editing app But really need more effects and I love it so much I get on it everyday trust me it’s the best And they Do new effects everyday I’m so happy my Fav app🥺🥺 I use it everyday and can y’all add trippy effects and more effects like Viedo star and new stuff Plz🥺 Love y’all have to get this app rn And you need to add where we can record from the app And the jiggle effect thank you💕
5,olivia ver,"Capcut is a very good app. But... It makes me delete my pictures and videos and even if I delete 10 they still confirm me about my storage I now have less pictures and videos and I think you should fix some bugs please. Thank you.                                                             -Olivia, From Nigeria"
4,SilverFoxx81739,"I love Capcut! I can tween and everything in this! But the Chroma Key is the only issue, and the tweening can get a bit wonky. I kinda wish that we could choose a area we dont want to be apart of the chrome key, like if we have a character with green eyes and we use a green screen, the eyes disappear with it. So this is a hurdle what is pretty hard to get over…  But besides these issues i have found, 10/10!"
4,kittylovehuv,"Ok so ive been using this app for a while but I had to delete it,the reason why is because I have recently had a lot of pictures and videos in my camera roll,so I decided to delete some, as I went back into capcut to see if the problem was fixed and still it was not, I hope you understand and fix the problem thank you and bye"
5,Jonahbakerflora,I went into CapCut and trying to edit stuff and wanted to put my saved tiktok sounds but it kept saying no internet connection please try again and I tried again and it won’t work I don’t want to like pre-record them my storage is about to go in max if I kept doing that so please fix it
5,noob queen,"So I have been using this app for year's and it is amazing but there is a simple problem it's with the fonts one of the fonts name is ""Autism"" it makes me so mad that you could of used any name for that font but you used a disorder A DISORDER!!! it's just gross of you people to do that please change it it's ticking me off so much 😐"
3,Electricrap,"CC is a great mobile editor, lots of bells and whistles. I spent the last 4 hrs chipping away at something you used to have to do in final cut, which is pretty awesome.  However I used the built in sound library only to find within minutes of uploading to TikTok that I got a copyright strike.   Music NEEDS to be clearly labeled if there is an exclusive copyright or it can be used. OR just make sure to get music that is free to use. It’s worthless otherwise"
5,fluffy uni 91012,"My friends had been doing edits and at first it didn’t appeal to me as it does now, this app is awesome like awesome, I know there maybe some bad reviews but trust me this app is great so much creativity, this app is great for beginners and even masters it’s great for all, now I love editing and it’s what I do in my spare time, thank you CapCut for making this app so great for all (download it you won’t regret)"
3,Jiminie's_JamsAlex,"It’s really good, I love the effect and how you can add text, but one small complaint, I feel like you should add more of a variety of songs, like K-pop and you should let people search up a song because they might not have it in their phone/iPad. So other than that this is an amazing app highly recommend if you are in love with making short videos/edits, but that’s the only complaint I have. But for now I’ll use this and Tempo."
5,sera brito,"Honestly, I love capcut. At first I had trouble editing but until I found capcut, I started to become a better pro at editing. Capcut was also the first editing app I ever downloaded besides iMovie. I think it’d be better for you to add more animations to make the edits more better, and I also want you to add more effects just so there is a bit more."
5,GregAmos33,"I’ve been using other apps to edit my dance videos until a friend asked me to get CapCut, I’m not sure there’s any other app in the world that’ll give you what CapCut offers and absolutely free😀Very easy to use and gives the best quality to your videos. Tbvh, this app deserves a 6 star rating. I love you guys and thank you 😊"
5,Von Win,"I was searching for a good free editing app, and this, IS AMAZING!!! I usually never review anything but THIS APP really deserves five stars. You are getting so many things for free. Everything is easy, and quick to used. I learned how to use a lot of the tools pretty fast. There are filters, stickers, text, ect, so much! You should really try this app when you get the chance. I LOVED IT!!!"
3,Oronee,"I really liked the app because it was very convenient to use. But after the new update, I can’t just use any feature of the app. Whenever I tap on any transitions, animations or any effects, it tells me that I don’t have an internet connection and I have to connect to one when I clearly have a good internet connection. I even tried using the app with VPN on but it still doesn’t work. Please do something! I really loved this app."
4,cmdjhdnrufhf,"I just downloaded Capcut a day ago but already I made 2 edits and when I try to play them (in the app) they will not play. Transitions, and the effects are good but I would suggest watching tutorials first. Like any editing app it is a bit complicated to learn at first like how to higher audio volume, but I think Capcut is an easier to learn editing app that is great. I would definitely suggest downloading Capcut."
3,trixie/maleiya,"Hi capcut, I love this app. Though, i don’t have much space on my phone so trying to start a new project is rough. What i would like to have is the ability to press on past projects to check which ones i would like to delete to free up some space. That’s all, everything else is great. Please just give us the ability to click on projects even when we can’t start a new project, so we can free up some space. Thank you!!"
2,Colton Kelly,I like the app a lot and I love to edit with it but there is a huge problem that I need fixed. Every time I make a small edit it takes up a huge amount of storage. I only made a few edits and it’s already taking up 11 gigabytes. And when my storage is full it’s always that app. When it’s full the app doesn’t let me open my edits. I need to see what edit is is to see if i can delete it. I don’t understand why it takes up so much storage but I want it fixed.
5,Neya285,I love this app it’s amazing but there is barely any music to pic from that will fit with the vid I’m making. Plus I can’t find the right music I want my vid to be and it’s kind of irritating and if one frame is to small I can’t go back and fix it but other than that I love this app so much!!!
3,Adneknas,"I honestly love Capcut and can edit so easily on it, but lately I’ve been having exporting problems. Every time I go to export a video it only gives me half of the video and stops at the first clip. Just today I worked on an edit for 2 hours and it came out all mixed up and the text was completely jumbled into the wrong places as well as the photos and clips. Please fix this glitch and I know it’s happening to others as well. Thank you."
4,Gabby gamini😛💜🧝🏼‍♀️🍀♊️,"I love this app 100%! But the thing is that “You insufficient storage” when clearly I have a lot of storage, that is the only thing that bothers me. Other than that it’s perfectly fine, and I would recommend it, oh one more thing.. If you guys could let use put more screenshots without the app glitching, that would be a MASSIVE help. But yeah again other than that this app is amazing!"
1,mskkkk22778)))%%%🤭🤫😥,"I've been using this app for quite some time and it's been going well until it tells me to clean up phone storage, i deleted some photos and it told me the same thing, i ended up deleting almost all the apps i've had and all the photos from my camera roll and it still told me to clean up storage, i don't know what is wrong with this app, but i can't use this anymore, i wasted my time deleting photos and edits i've been working on for nothing, don't waste your time using an app that tells you to clean up phone storage like this one."
1,avaxsilver,i was editing a video and when i tried to save it it said i didn’t have a bough storage so i cleared some pictures out and went to settings and i literally had 15gb ? i even deleted all my other edits on the app bc i thought maybe that would work but it was saying the same thing still. then u thought i would just start over on what i was editing but it doesn’t even let me do that so i un-installed the app and redownloaded it but it STILL doesn’t let me do anything. i’m really disappointed because i like this app but it’s doing this for some reason.
5,pppoopoochecl,"capcut is so good i love it, it doesn’t have any water marks, ads, and it doesn’t cost money. like other apps you have to unlock effects by buying it but everything is free on this plus it has no water marks. i love is smmm. i downloaded this app cause i saw somebody posted a tutorial how to use it on Tik tok and its not hard like video star plus nothing cost money!!"
4,genyplays,But I feel they should give us more than presets I feel like we should be able to make our own transitions. I know they have some but they look choppy. But I feel like they should add more things to make your own transitions. But other that I love this app so much so many things you can do with this and everything is free. I feel like this app is very underrated.
3,akkahdjsbshshdhdh,"Don’t get me wrong I LOVE this app, it’s easy, gives you the option to remove the watermark, and it’s worked perfectly up until now...I get my audio clips from TikTok to edit and it’s always worked but this time it doesn’t. For ex) one of my audios had 25 seconds on it but when I went to put it on capcut it cut the audio down to 6 seconds ?! It’s so frustrating, I deleted the app and reinstalled it so many times but it’s still like that ?"
4,gamz👎,"i really like this app and use it for my edits as its the only free option i have! however i'd really like a way to be able to add smooth transitions between overlays like you can with the maintrack. an issue i've also noticed is when using the transition feature on the maintrack, the buttons become too small to press and you can't select a clip."
5,skittlechild,"Yes I am going to be one of those people who says they don’t write reviews, because I don’t, but this app is so useful and fun to edit with, you don’t have to pay money which I appreciate so much and the app itself has so many features. The only bad thing I would say is, it can be a bit glitchy sometimes. Keep up the great work devs!"
5,lotuseana,"this is really one of the simplest, easy to use, yet powerful editing apps i have ever use. it has a lot of great features, especially for transitions and animations, and not confusing like other apps are. i’ve used this app a lot over the past week to edit videos for that one tiktok trend :)  the only thing that i would add to the app is keyframes, so that the animations can be as smooth and flawless as possible. i’ve tried out several other apps that have keyframes, but i keep coming back to capcut because it’s easier to use. please consider adding this feature! i’m sure it could help me and many other users :) thank you!"
3,GwLakshmi,"Not sure if there was update or what triggered it, but it was wonderful to use and easy to create great videos for so long…. Until something triggered the audio and video to misalign so badly that it’s impossible to use the app anymore. I don’t even have to edit the file, it’s already corrupted as soon as I import it. So, other than being completely unusable at the moment, this app is otherwise really great."
4,shxnyhxbi,"It’s an amazing app and stuff but I have three edits on the page and deleted all my photos and still telling me that my storage is full, and need update. I updated, still didn’t work. And I add 60fps but nothing changes and when I put some overlays and stuff it lags so much. Such a great app but it really ruins the quality of my videos or/and photos"
5,sxfia.exe,"This app is absolutely amazing I’ve been using it for a long time now. I’m pretty sure like 6 month’s. It’s free! It’s amazing and it has a lot of features that you can use after all it’s a very good editing app! You can add the videos onto other apps, and it has very nice effects and features to use for beginners."
5,Lilianamama24,"I wasn’t very good at editing at all. And that was mainly because i used Video Star, once I started using the app though. MY FRIENDS LOVED MY EDITS!! The only downside I have is the fact that you need to be online to use a lot of things. If you’ve used them before you can use them online, which I think is pretty cool! 😄 Thank you CapCut for making me a happy girl!!!!"
3,abby me sis is anna,"I LOVE(d) CapCut but all of a sudden it says I cannot edit because I need to allow access to albums, I click on it, it brings me to settings, and I try everything on my settings, it still doesn’t go away. I recommend getting the app but have fun with it while it lasts, I hope a bug like that doesn’t pop up for your. Other then that, it’s super amazing but I’m so angry because that’s the only app I fully knew how to use so I’m not sure what im gonna do😭😭😭😭😭"
3,follow my new tiktok plss,So...first off what I got to say is. I barely have apps on my phone! So every time I wanna edit something on capcut it says my storage is full I delete an app then I only have 3-4 apps left then it work but i shouldn’t have to do that my camerroll isn’t even that much full to where CapCut should say that- But after all CapCut is a very good editing app for no payment I really like I just hate the storage part cause no editing app does that but CapCut and that’s a shame  Ps.. PLEASE FIX THAT PROBLEM TY😗✌🏾
4,LilGachaTuber,"I LOVE THIS APP it’s so good and easy to work with, people say its not and editing app which i agree but disagree. I think it’s not and editing app because it doesn’t have the things to make a profesional edit. I think capcut should just add graphs and mirroring edges (or whatever they are called). Those are the only things i recommend, but i still love this app and will still always use it!"
4,skylarsmommy12,Ok so I do the template stuff and I’m just looking at the edits and stuff. All I do is that then it goes slow but I try pressing it again and it says “free up phone storage” I just barely got on there though. And I have enough storage. It’s making me mad cause just for this I have to delete everything. I’m losing my stuff. I thinking of deleting it after all that hard work.
4,Vickyjr.09,I have this app on my phone and the animations don’t work. It always says that I have unstable internet connection and I fix my WiFi and it still says that. None of the previews for the animations show either. I also have it on my I pad and it works perfectly. Like what?? The 2 devices are on the SAME wifi so I don’t really know anymore.  I love using it for funny edits and it’s awesome. I don’t know what it is.
5,Kayley Nicole Miranda,"This app is the perfect app for editing.  Its really nice for tiktoks and other stuff.  Although it needs some more things in it, what i mean by that is like maybe better quality and some other stuff that people add to make their video nice. This app is really amazing I use it everyday! I would recommend getting this app."
5,KateMayy,"Okay well yes, this app is great! I use it for all my edits and videos. I just have a suggestion. So, I know how you can but overlays and everything? I wonder if you could put multiple overlays at once. Just a concept, because whenever I try to add more then one overlay I have to choose one. Overall, this app is outstanding."
5,Dog fan hehehe no..,"Overall my experience is really good! No watermark and it’s all free! The transitions could use work, but there really good. I would like to see a motion blur that you can add on moving layers, text etc. that would make the app 10x better! I also would like to see custom transitions where you can save them as a custom transition preset type thing."
5,RowboQueen👌,This app is the best editing app there is so far but one time it wasn’t working so I deleted it then got the app back and my stuff and all the videos I edited were gone so I had redo everything could you make it where you have an account so it saves your stuff or anything that saves your progress please?
4,кαкуσιи,"This app is pretty good! I love all the features and the quality. I’d rate this app 10/10! So why did I give it 4 stars? Well, it’s not necessary the app. It’s the updates. On TikTok, I see all these people using the “Auto Velocity” feature. I’ve updated my capcut more than once and I still don’t have the feature. The feature would really be helpful for the types of edits I make."
5,Allisa Carrie,"Capcut is absolutely amazing! Easy to use, built in transitions! (Even available to make your own) MULTIPLE LAYERS!! They dont even have a watermark! May i add the app is FREE?- The stickers are also amazing! And even put in your own music (Thankful for the video import feature!) I recommend this for starter editors but i mean everyone can use it! Im experienced editor yet capcut is so useful!"
3,8226352,"So i got this app yesterday. This app is The best video editing app i’ve downloaded it’s free and has some awesome features! Today when I went to get on the app, I went to click the video I was editing, and the app froze. I tried refreshing going in and out, But nothing worked. I’m not sure if it’s my phone or the app, I just wanted to finish the edit I was doing because so far I put a lot of effort into it and i don’t want to restart..."
5,berry_da,"This is literally such an amazing editing app, im literally super stupid and basically gave up on editing after trying after effects. But this app is super user friendly and even a dummy like me can make the edits that i think about. It has so many cool effects and easy to understand. Thanks for making this amazing app, im a die hard fan♡"
1,Alexizzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"God. this app literally like physically angers me, if you want to move fast, you can’t since the app is poorly made. its super inconsistent. i have an audio set and even at the same timestamp another part of the audio will play compared to the original part that it was, if i try to make a movement later on into the video i have to slowly start in the beginning for the audio to render again, and you cant even scroll past it or wait for it to catch up because it wont ever render. this is on an iphone 12. find another one. hot garbage"
5,mirmoney$,I was a little bit intimidated at first because I thought it would be difficult because I see all of these YouTubers making videos with insane edits but I’ve been using this for a few months now and it’s so easy and it’s really helped build my confidence and imagination with editing
4,Viol3tMobst,Like the title CapCut is an amazing app for editors to make what they please! There are a lot of things to do there but the one thing i want to touch’s on is overlay it changed A LOT like is you would slide it to one it was literally almost gone and its not smooth as it used to be I’m not sure if it’s just the phone I’m using or something wrong with it but yea.   Have a good day thank you for reading this!
5,Roblox fortnite fan,"This app is simply amazing. My friend told me to use this app to edit vids, and so I tried it. I didn’t know what I was doing at first, but I got the hang of it later on, with no video at all. It was easy for me, idk for anyone else, but yes it’s awesome. The editing is awesome, and yea that’s all I have to say. I really recommend getting this app if you want to make videos."
5,Dexter! <3,"I’m a gacha animator, and i used to use kinemaster for everything, but using Capcut is sooo much easier. Everything is smoother and you can find stuff more easily. There are also more effects and animations then there are in kinemaster, along with things that aren’t in kinemaster. 10/10 recommend, as it is very good editing software"
2,Very annoyed at something!!,CapCut is amazing for editing my videos or pictures but when I try adding a picture a lot of times I have to go to settings to allow it cause it doesn’t allow my to access! And when I make a very tiny period it does not show until I save it into my camera role and that is very annoying and I want those to be fixed because I cannot tell if it’s right or wrong when I can’t see if I made a mistake or not and I am very annoyed at that
5,allie💅😘,I was so happy when I first got it and don’t look back I have been an editor for 2 years now yes there are some bugs when you try and do the lens blur trend but overall good editing app  I think cap cut should add lens blur and not have us do this hacks to do lens blur it would make me happy and a lot more editors because not everyone can get AE
4,texesfox,"It’s an amazing app with great features I definitely recommend, you can even get rid of the end card which I really like, the only problem is with the key frames, when you first start using key frames everything is fine, but after a couple of frames it refuses to work, I hope it will soon get fixed"
5,drzuniga,So is good and all and it’s really helping me out with videos and edits but there’s one small problem whenever I use CapCut for too long it starts to lag and the frames get stuck in place whenever is the next Frame but that’s OK so I just had to delete it and re-download it and it was fixed
4,disappointedcustomer9173931,"App is great. Definitely recommend for editors who can’t afford software. However, I am a bit upset that the background noise reducer doesn’t work, regardless of the video or audio I try to use it on. I wouldn’t have an issue if I could find other apps to remove the background noise of videos for, but there aren’t any free ones. Hopefully they fix this soon."
5,chanman42141,I’ve been using this app and I love it  I’ve been making lyric videos with this app  And I’ve been wanting to have a constant animation while having a start and end animation on a text  So it can make the videos more defined  But I rate this app 10/10 it’s perfect for a beginner very easy to use as well
5,Eryn Rayleeann Holt,"All I want to say is, please let us be able to put more then just 6 overlays. I’m trying to tween and with only 6 it’s not complete. And when you’re putting effects and there’s an overlay,can we please have an option to either if we wanna have the effects on the overlay or not. That would help a lot!"
5,WHY R THE NAMES ALL TAKEN,"So I was going around App Store and saw this, it’s a very useful app it’s just that it always says “fix storage” or whatever and I deleted some of my pics and it still said it, it’s super annoying like I cant even go look at a video I made! Anyways this is a very good app for Gacha life players and other stuff so definitely recommend"
4,muzazah,"Hi my name is zahra! Overall I LOVE this app. So many Greta features like Texts, Effects, Songs and MUCH more! But what I don’t like about it is that when you have no space you can’t make anything. And one time I had lots of space in my iPad, but it said something like “no iPad storage” so yeah overall I recommend this app if you have a yt channel or just for fun :) I rate it a 4!"
5,rhdyg,This app is amazing because it makes my videos look even better and there’s a lot of options to choose from and I pick different kinds of choices and I post them on TikTok and I get a lot of likes and it’s m only a kid so it just makes me really really happy to have a lot of likes on all of my videos
5,Jinxy_Kitty,"I gave it a 5 star because the app is really great and easy to use but all all of a sudden the animations started getting laggy and not working right, I’m not sure why and I’m caught up on all the updates too. Maybe just a small bug but otherwise great app! And I love how easy it is to edit everything!!"
5,Satisfied customer - from VA,"I’ve been needing something to make editing my videos easier, and my friend recommended CapCut to me. So far, it’s amazing! I haven’t really figured out all the features yet, but the ones I’ve used are great! It makes putting my videos together so much easier!! The fact that it’s free is also amazing! This is an amazing app in my opinion."
2,Person Who LOVES Dogs!,I had been using this app for maybe a month and it was ok. I was cleaning out my photos to make room. Then I opened up capcut and tried looking at a few videos but every time it said Insufficient Storage. I continued to delete more and more photos and now I have very few but it still says Insufficient Storage. Then I decided to delete and re install capcut. It still said Insufficient Storage. So now I have to find a new video editor because I can’t use capcut. I was actually starting to like it.
4,Katie4468864,"This app is just great. I’m able to edit videos for free and add transitions, sound, effects, text, and more. And there’s no watermark! But I feel like it’s missing some stuff.  The audio is great. There’s lots of sounds and music. But I use capcut a lot for music videos where I pick a song and make a video outa it. But not a lot of the songs have actual singing in it,  It’s mostly just background music.  Maybe a drawing option? Since I’m an artist, sometimes I like to use my drawings in a project. But to do that I have to draw something, save it, and import it to capcut. And a lot of times it’s just a simple sketch which takes like 15 secs to draw. I feel like this would really be helpful."
5,White Diamond🤍,"Don’t get me wrong, I love capcut- but sometimes when I try to make an edit it keeps saying I have to clear storage- even tho I barely have photos- so I get mad sometimes bc It won’t let me make anything- over all it’s a good editing app I love the effects and everything- but it’s just that- that’s bothering me. But I love the app I recommend!"
4,A pOtAtO kgn,"This app is great, I love it. I use it every day to make edits. Every other app I’ve tried to use has so many things that you need to buy, and there’s barely anything you can do without buying premium. But this one’s great! And there are so many effects, animations, transitions, filters, stickers, and more! It’s also so easy to use, it’s not complicated at all. I recommend this app to everyone."
4,Lexi ♡︎,I absolutely LOVE capcut. There are a few things that stop me from editing though. The transitions stopped working after a few days and I can only use the ones I’ve used before. When I try the other ones it tells my that my internet connection isnt working. I think it’s a bug because the ones I’ve used before work perfectly fine.
5,I LOVE OR HATE THIS APP!!!!,"This app helps me with editing! I love the options it gives you! Even an undo button :0! Life changer! Get this app! It helps soooo much!  Just a thing, when your editing if your like me, I love editing tons, and tons, and tons. So if your life me it’s kinda time consuming. But after it feels so good and you love the thing you just made! Request this app!"
5,valenxt1,"I like the app CapCut. My friend introduced this CapCut and I Like it a lot! One problem is. Everytime my storage is full why do I have to delete apps? I only have 5 apps for real. Can you please fix? And also, it would be greatful if you add fonts, I know there are some fonts but can you do fonts that you can download from? Thanks! 🔥 keep up great work"
5,lily trescout,"Ong I love this app and it’s great! I’m really happy that there is NO watermarks and there so much things you can do with it! It’s definitely great and I suggest you should try it if you have not, and also what I like about this app is that it has many different effects and ALOT if animation. I’ve been using this for a long time now and when ever I do edits, I go on there and I LOVE OT😋"
2,GachaKittyYT,"Now I’ve used a lot of editing apps in my life, and Capcut is by FAR the best one I’ve ever used. It gives you a variety of things for editing without you having to pay at all. However, there is one bug that’s causing me to rate 2 stars. Even if you select certain photos to be able to be used in editing, certain ones won’t show up to import into the edit. This is a huge problem and makes editing with this app almost impossible."
5,ALEX1434,"This is a very good app and all but for some reason my effects, overlays, filters, edit, text, stickers, etc. isn’t working and I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling and it still won’t work I really wanna use your app I love this but I can’t do anything if this isn’t working I rate it five stars bc I love this but can you fix it pls."
4,why I haet tiktok,I love the app but you can only export the video if it is 15 minutes Long so that make hard to do some stuff and I wish there was a way to make a time lapse but there isn’t and I wish there was some more music they have a lot but I wouldn’t put them in any of my videos just A personal preference but I love the app if that got added I would love it more and if that change to.💖😊
3,Ya_Boi_Tapiøn,"Imma start off by saying that it is a really great app, but i have recently ran into a problem. Some videos that I edit will always “Fail to export”, and no matter how many times I try it always fails to export right at the end. It can’t possibly be my connection as the blame because i keep a steady connection. I just hope there is a way to fix the issue so i can export them finally instead of letting them sit and rot. Thank you 🙏🙏"
4,少诱惑我,"This editing app is amazing! Ive been using it for almost a year now. (you should download it if your a beginner) Theres one problem though, the problem is that the style button isnt showing up. I tried to do everything but it still doesnt show. Please fix this bug but everything else is perfectly fine!"
5,princessbalz,I love this app so much… it’s awesome but then I really suggest capcut makes it possible to keep your data even after deleting the app  I mean make it possible to create an account to store all your videos in even when the app is deleted… other than that this app is awesome and definitely really recommended!
4,"ddd+bhgujhu,khjmhi,h,u","Yes I mean EVERYONE!! This app is amazing I use it literally every day every night every minute (#addicted) I love how you can add your own music and use music it already provides!! I’ve been looking for a video making app that’s good for decades now  I finally found one!! I want to say a huge thank you for not really having ANY in app purchases!! Sincerely, I satisfied customer!!"
4,Magic sillies,"Yes, you heard me. This editing app is so amazing, and has no bounds. One thing that bugs me, though, is that you cannot watch any of your creations when your “storage is full”. This is the only reason that this has a four star rating. Everything else-from the millions of creations to learn from, to the amazing sound effects + visual effects.   9.6/10, love it!"
5,Trashed_out,Hey!! I really love this app but hate that it isn’t on a computer and would love if it was still tryin learn I’m a starter but love the app so for but really wish it was on a computer because I only switch now and find it a bit hard to use on a phone. But over all it’s a very good app and would very much so recommend!!
1,JennieHere UwU,"Ok, first, yes. Just, lovely. But- can y’all add more lqbtqia+ stickers..? That would be nice :) uhm anyways, there rly is nothing wrong with this app- I use it for anime and DSMP edits- and it actually works better then I thought it would.. *flash backs to IMovie* oh, and can u plsssssssssssssssssssssss add the rat filter? Ty :) also, can there be more transitions and animations? Kinda limited there 🤠 also, with the auto text thing can u make it so it puts captions to songs? I make edits for tiktok and YT and I wanna put captions without taking 5 mins of my life to type them out ｡ﾟ(ﾟ´ω`ﾟ)ﾟ｡ laziness~ uhm but overall CapCut is good. I MAKE NO SENSE I AM SO SORRY"
5,im black 69420,This app is so good but the only thing that could make it better is an account option where if you accidentally delete the app all of your edits will be there when you log into your account and if there is an account option please tell me how to access it
4,bulgaria 🇧🇬,"I love CapCut, there are so many possibilities of things you can create with the app and you can do it all. The one issue I have is with cropping images. For some reason if I try to crop the image into a format, the image doesn’t stay cropped. It has only worked in one of my projects and I would like to know why. Overall though, highly recommend using CapCut."
5,jamila-land of stars,I loved it I used to use KineMaster so much it is very easy  And so many options for stickers and I love it and very easy You can animate and stuff I’m a gachatuber and I’m sofiscated I do full body animations and there’s a small problem when I try to full body animate after 6/7 overlays it says maximum overlay tracks which I just want fixed
5,fcuckutd,"This is a great beginner app it's really easy too use. People bash it, but that's really not a problem. Though I do think the slomo is a bit choppy I still like it. I never get frustrated while doing a edit except for when you have the storage problem thing but that would be my fualt. So overall I rate this a 5"
5,AstheticPastel,I have always wanted a yt channel and recently found out how to record. But I didn’t know how to edit talk about having editing apps then I downloaded yours and it was the BEST you can have effects filters cut crop do anything you want it is perfect for a beginner you are very talented making this app and I would like to thank j for being in this world:)
5,Hondurenozthgrhhyt,So I like this app! I make videos with it and there’s something confusing when I look at the Home Screen where I see all the videos I make on the bottom of the video it has a number and the letter M Is it like I have million lovers or maybe something else could you just ask me about it?
4,StarWarsGirl53,"This app is AMAZING!!! There was just one problem. I was try to edit vids and for a while the effects worked but then on day it wouldn't download the effect and say ""no internet connection"" even though I have strong internet. I deleted the app and re downloaded it, now it works perfectly but it would've been a problem if I had more than one project."
5,billy4431,"This is the BEST app for editing but there are A LOT of glitches with the key frames and if you doing a lot of editing on your videos, when playing them over again the video glitches and slows down and lag. Great app but I hope future fixes happen soon!"
3,rain🌧💦☔️,I downloaded this a long time ago thinking it was perfect and it was! I made funny gaming videos with my brother. But the problem is.. I accidentally deleted it today. I lost all my videos and the funny moments with my brother. When I downloaded it again i thought it would come back. The reason why I am reporting this is because I really need an account for capcut and I’m sure other people would want that too.
5,moontaha2011,So yes I know capcut it awsome but the the problem is I cant get it because my version is 10.3 and it's 4.23 I think so can you please change the version so I can get it and my device is not compatible with this app because of the version so can u lower it like to 9.3 so I can get it please I beg u please!!! Keep the good work!!!!!!! ;)
4,Nevaleevbk,"I downloaded this app (I don’t remember why) and haven’t used it. For whatever reason I started recently and I’m impressed with it. Has a lot of features that it’s hard to replicate if you don’t have the templates in other apps. The only thing I don’t like it that u can import music from Documents or other platforms, yes u can do iTunes. But if I could import other music it would be A+"
5,BOSTEN RED SOCKS,"For anyone who is a beginner with editing, this would be your app. I don’t get any glitches, and the app is completely free. I love this app, honestly. I see no flaws. CapCut has everything you need. Filters, animations, overlays, amazing fonts, and more. Overall, easy 10/10 editing app. You can do everything with this!"
5,Wolfiemilly,"I love it but there is a bug. I added a sticker and all of a sudden it got removed when I exported the video. I put good quality on a video and when I exported it, it was all black just a black screen. Please fix this! Other than I think it should have more shaking and flashing effects. Please fix these things!"
5,crazy catss,"I LOVE THIS APP it’s really great a lot of effects! Filters,songs,stickers, etc. I had made a lot of videos! I really really love this app I get on it every day but one day it had lost all my videos I put a lot of time into making those videos I am really mad!😩I totally recommend you get it! But Idk how to fix this!!  Edit: I got my videos back some how"
4,DaisyRidley'sBiggestFan,I’ve used capcut for almost all of my edits I’ve ever made and it is definitely one of the best editing apps out there. Overall it is great but I have one major suggestion- is there anyway to make the blur 2 fade out effect any faster? If so it would be super helpful for making my edits! Love capcut💞
5,hdmndbdvdgdhdh,"this app is awesome, i’ve just recently discovered it and it has way more features than my old app i used, inshot. Although, i will say inshot was a bit easier to use and i would definitely recommend it to begginers. tbf tho, i just got this app, so i could discover some issues, but so far, i have had no problems!"
5,Kay_24Z,"This is app is reallyyyyyy good for starters they have so many transitions,flashes,effects,and etc!I recommend you to use Capcut  if you’re new to editing!And it’s free and there are no items that you can purchase, it’s all free.!Although it may be very laggy on longer videos but other than that I recommend this app for starters."
3,Thumbnail issui,"So my wife stopped working for awhile and I was ok but then,when it came back on I wanted edit a video for my cat and I connected my TikTok sound list to CapCut so I went to check it so I can use a sound,but it said no internet an my wifi was working at the time so I pressed to so it can refresh but,IT STILL didn’t work! So I have to delete CapCut lose all my videos and connect CapCut back to my TikTok and it’s annoying 🥱"
5,Nmorka,So I been make lots of TikTok’s right and I think CapCut should have a velocity button because if that did you guys could possibly beat other editing apps because on CapCut everything is free and if they had free velocity everybody would be using CapCut because you don’t need a subscription just to use certain stuff
3,Budgielover001,"I like cap cut a lot but sometimes animating it or trying to scale and move overlays are just annoying! Today for example I was editing and had to move a overlay that was sideways to animate it. For some reason the overlay went all the way to the other side of the video, then when I tried to put it back it just would not stay still! It was like it had a will of it’s own."
4,ggfvhhgfg,"So, I’ve been editing with CapCut for a while, and everything was fine, until a couple days ago. I was trying to edit a video, and when I tried to use the slider to move my video, it kept turning it into one small clip and move the whole thing, and when I split it, it just moved the rest of the video with it, can someone help me please?"
5,FANCYTRASH,"The app is amazing! It is clearly well made and has a lot of effects/transitions to choose from! It’s great to use whether you’re a beginner or professional! To me, this is on par with other great apps out there or may even be better! I honestly find this app to be underrated and should definitely be recognized and recommended to everyone!"
5,X DEADZOMBIE X1,"I was using the go pro app to edit my videos but that platform is very difficult when it comes to downloading videos, but with Capcut there is no problem at all. Although capcut is somtimes hard to get used to you will get the hang of it and make amazing things :) so get this app and lets see your cool videos!"
4,melanie toliver,I think this app is great but I feel like their should be a option for velocity edits in speed so that it automatically slows the video down and speeds up like a normal velocity edit would. Also PLEASE add a effect that enhances the lighting of the original video/photo. And other than that the app is pretty great and to me doesn’t need anymore improvements.
4,Kristina Caballero,"It’s an amazing app and i’ve edited many videos on it but now it keeps saying ’Couldn’t Import, please try again later’ which i do. I reopen the app and wait a while but i still doesn’t let me upload the videos i want to add. 😔 I genuinely like this app and it helped me edit videos, please respond so i can know what’s wrong. For now, i’ll try restarting my phone till it works. 🙂"
5,:^^^^^>>,"I just want to say, this app is great, I would marry it if I could! LOL. And it’s great to make edits with, but I would really love more transitions and stuff. All of them are getting kind of boring.. but the animation ones are great too. And I just think this is a good app in general, but it probably does need a few fixing here and there, but I would definitely download it!!!"
5,Akeliss,This is an amazing app! Even though I deleted a bunch of my edits and photos in my camera roll and it says “try to clear up some storage and try again” and I even bought more storage on my phone and it still says I need more storage. I don’t know if it’s a bug or not but I can’t fix it
5,💞alexi💞,"I have had CapCut for a long time to edit my videos and Im in love! CapCut has many transitions I use for my edits! Even if CapCut gets hate, I will still love it! I have never seen such a good editing app before! I do wish you could change the voice to speech text to have a spanish accent or something like that! But overall I love CapCut!"
5,Emelieyy,Hey I LOVE your app but my problem is when I edited one day and there was a post on tik Tok thing so I clicked it but it restarted my tik Tok and it logged me out of my accounts so idk if it’s just me but I used it agin the other time and when I wanted to get on tik tok it restarted the whole thing AGAIN so pls fix this bug ty!Pls answer
5,Cardendapro1,"this app is INSANE, SO GOOD FOR EDITING! WITH NO STUPID PREMEIUM THING! if your looking for a mobile editing app this one is for you, first of all, with this app, you can slow down anything you want, second, you can edit using the split button, cut out what ever you want, third, well, just download the app and see ;), this app has so much to offer :)."
5,ashleyloveicy,I love how it has so much features to use! and unlike like video star we have to all the make all the effect but here we only tap on the effect and it puts it on for us I’m not trying to be rude I’m any way to video star but I love this app more and plus video star we have to pay money  unlike capcut we don’t have to pay
3,jebrjdiw,"The app is incredible and has helped me gain over 300 followers on TikTok, but all of a sudden it is not allowing to go back to edit videos saved on the app due to “insufficient storage” when it had no problem letting me use it when I already had terrible storage on my phone. It is 100 percent free and I totally recommend. Be careful with your storage I was able to make about 6 videos before the app said something about it"
5,eevee28th,Okay so this app is really amazing like the title says itself. And to top it off you can do a bunch of stuff FOR FREE! You can get a membership I think if you would like but for being free it’s great! It’s really good for editing starters I definitely recommend this app to anyone that’s trying to edit a video of any sort! Very helpful app I love it❤️
5,lunaboooze,I found this app and I thought “might as well try it”   This is probably one of the best editing apps I’ve ever gotten. It has great assets and even music! Most of the ones I've gotten costed money to make it good quality. This is completely free with pretty good quality. It’s has built in stickers and great transitions! I love it so much! Thanks for this app!
4,Yourgametrash6219262,"So here’s the story, I was thinking about editing. So I wanted to do a velocity edit. I am a beginner editor so I don’t know how to do it on my own so I wanted to do auto velocity in style. Then. I realized. There was no style! I couldn’t do auto velocity in style. I checked every single button and  there was no style. I don’t think anybody had This problem but I have. Can you fix it?"
1,Zia Gaming,"Before this app became CapCut, you could edit videos with ease and then save them to your phone. Now when you go to export them, it ONLY lets you upload them to tiktok. Tiktok is a crap platform. I have never used it and never will. When you “export” the video, it says it saved it as a project AND to your device, but it only saves it as a project and does not save them to your device, which means you either have to share them on tiktok or don’t share them it all. Uninstalled. Will be looking for a new app. This one went to hell."
4,puppy dpg 12234582,"I think CapCut is good, you can edit however you want and put amazing filters but there is just one problem. It always says that I don’t have enough storage and that I need to clean it out I can’t delete everything on my phone for editing. I also would love to have name stickers and you can just search your name up and there it is."
4,bieaman,"This app is super easy to use and makes video editing come easy. My only issue so far is that even on wifi, I am unable to sync my own sounds to the videos I make. Even after updating and redownloading the app. Hopefully an update that corrects this problem comes along soon so I can keep editing my videos."
5,hdiebidbsk,I have used this app for a while then I got funimate still great I just crop of the watermark so I don’t have to pay I still use CapCut and I also combine them together (my tiktok is “hayhayedits”) if anyone wants it but yea the app is wonderful love everything it does it’s amazing uhm so I hope everyone has a great rest of their day/night! :)
2,Miracle Townsend :)))(,"Hi I’ve used CapCut for over a year now, I’m a fanpage on tiktok and I use it for my coloring on iPhone, I used vignette for my coloring yesterday following the steps and I tried using it today and it seems that it updated to where when I use it it looks extremely different and very bad which ruins the entire video, I was hoping that you guys could fix this problem immediately because it’s not good at all, so yea I’m eating this a 2 because it’s not fixed and it looks horrible."
4,Cate00000,"I love this app very much! I do lots of edits on it and make so many fun videos! The one thing I don’t like about this app is it needs more text to speech voices. There are only 3 and not very good. Also, the voice changer voices sound the same. Chipmunk, elf, and high, all sound the exact same. So what I’m saying is, add more text to speech voices and change the voice changer! The rest of this App is amazing!"
4,Ginaleeallen,"This is a very good app for editing. I just have one minor problem. The max amount for overlays. I used about 5-7 overlays for tweening, and when I’m about to add the last few capcut says that I can’t add any more overlays. I’m not saying get rid of the max overlay thing completely, but maybe make the number to maybe 10-12 overlays? Other than that, capcut is a really good app."
5,drift ancor,This is definitely a five star editing app. This is amazing because it has no watermark and you can make things so very smooth. It is very easy to use and edit with. Only downside is that the text needs to be able to make actual animations and stuff like that but overall five ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
4,FurryPotatoYT,"I love it a lot and my yt channel is grow bc of it, but sometimes when I try the ‘shortcut’ it tells me it’s unavailable or I have to try again later :l it also can be a bit difficult when you are trying to find a specific filter and have to hop it will pop up when you refresh. Great app, again tho"
4,martinelli's damaged cartilage,"I’ve been using CapCut for a while now and honestly, I love this app. From the effects, the simplicity, and even the similarity it has to Alight Motion regarding the keyframes. The reason I give it 4 is because there are keyframes without graphs, which kind of defeats the purpose of them. I’d definitely suggest adding graphs so people who make their transitions using keyframes can be either slower or faster depending on the graph."
3,Toby / Kai / Leo,"It’s a good app and I use it quite a lot. I don’t know if this is a problem for just me or others though, whenever I go to use text it no longer gives me the option to change the opacity. I used to be able to change it and have to problems but now it is just faded out and I can’t change it. I would appreciate it if someone could help me with this issue"
5,M_Sobirjonov,"I've been using this app for a good 6 months now, and it is absolutely great compared to other apps. I like my videos to be nice and crisp, so i record in 4K. But on capcut, you can't upload your videos in 4k which is a bummer. I'd appreciate it if the Capcut app could support uploading in 4k. It would make this app perfect. Thanks in advance!"
5,Isabella. W,"So I love this game I’ve had it for 2 years or 3… but I don’t care really,….but overall I love this app but it sometimes freezes or glitches for me idk if it’s my phone or something but yea is a great app I love it so much but yea that’s just what I wanted to say but to everyone that see’s this hope you have a good day/night/afternoon/evening bye!"
5,kellie sheller,Very good beginners app! I love the fact it saves progress! (Almost every editing app does) I had ABSOLUTELY ZERO idea how to put YOUR OWN MUSIC (record a video on what music you want put that in overlay your piece and done) but the storage for me it took up was LITERALLY 11.(something) GIBS. I ONLY MADE 2 VIDS AND IT TOOK UP THAT MUCH SPACE?! Are you joking?! But still very VERY good app.
5,yo dont have one,This app is sooo good for Roblox transitions! I recommend getting it! There are so many filters and so many options to do with the movie your making! There is nothing I don’t like about this app! If you get this app you will def enjoy it! Now thanks for reading my short rating! I really had nothing to say about this! But have a great day!
2,ECat063662,"I downloaded this app a few minutes ago, and everything was completely accessible up until I got to the editor. After that, none of the things I clicked on were not compatible with voiceover and would not say anything when I clicked on them. This makes the app completely unusable for me other than creating a project and adding photos to the project. Please fix this as soon as possible."
5,Lune Areaste,"When I heard of this app, I doubted because I used other apps like splice and stuff. I thought this would disappoint me but it's better than all the other apps. Practically everything is free, there's so much things you can use. Though I am disappointed by the music thing it's perfect, I give it a 5 out of 5!"
2,Xxbella_rulesxX1,I gave this a 3 because it’s good for making MINI edits but at some point it deleted all of my work i was able to redo some and idk if this is a limit but it kept saying I wasn’t allowed to export a 12 minute video although my phone had space until i deleted the rest it exported halfway threw then it said my phone had no space so then I recovered an older video that exported fine and it no longer worked but my phone has more storage then when I WAS able to export the video.
5,HeyItsMeHailee,This app is awesome!! There is so many features that would take me hours to hand-do! It’s super easy and my videos turn out fabulous with this app! The only problem is in the beginning of my clip it will softly glitch and then things will go back to normal. I don’t know if it’s my phone or what but yeah. Everything else is great!!
4,Galaxy wolf Studios,I don’t know if you recently updated it but when I go to put text or copy text it reverts the text back to The default style. Also text to speech pronounces “Gacha” weird. Also when you press play and editing voiceover and everything tend to stall. It’s making it difficult.
5,LanaEmma1,"I’m under the age for it butttt, this app is freakin AWESOME it’s the best editing app! My life would be nothing without this! I love the app but.... it can use some changes, Like maybe no vip I would like that! And... More effects I would like more of the bling to me like Hearts and other stuff, it’s a pretty cool app, But I would add these changes straight away!"
5,Mira9999999,CapCut is awesome. But I have been having issues getting in to my videos to edit them and to save them. It won’t let me scroll down in the video area anymore and it won’t let me press anything. The whole and has frozen completely. I love the app but I just need it to stop freezing.
5,RobloxYTber,"The amount of features on this app is incredible, and it free! it has so much, and this app is free! This is a great editing app for those who want to start although, I have a problem, I use shakes and it’s hard for me to put a lot, I have a suggestion for the creators, can you please add a feature where you can cut effects?"
5,Arelyy.Parkerr,"I’m so thankful i found this app on an instagram ad!! The animations & effects are incredible! I really wanted to start editing but almost all the professional editing apps make you pay. So thank you cap cut for making it easy for me! I highly recommend you get this app, it’s a life saver for all you instagram editors!!"
5,joanna borloh,This app is a very easy way to edit video and fun to watch when your done!!! I think you should download because it make people happy. Another think you should reason why you should download it is because it not that long to edit to but I think you should download it.
4,problem29280292029,"I love the app. But I kind of with the slow motion was more smooth for videos. Because when I try to make edits, the slow motion makes them look rough. Would love for you to fix that pls. Other than that, I love the app.  So update, I love the smooth slo mo but it takes so long to load. I literally have to wait at least  9 minutes for it to be at 63"
1,Hello!?! :),"I have so many problems with Capscut. Now here is the thing, Capscut is an amazing video editor and it has so many wonderful features. But after about 5 months now, it won’t work. It doesn’t let me go into the app, it wont let me export, audio delays, video quality gone down, crashes every 10-15 minutes, and overall lagging. I reinstalled it and made sure my wifi was the best but it’s not the device. It’s the application. Please fix this so I can go back to the wonderful 5 star app it was 5 months ago."
2,Lovleylakekazie,"Ok, so, I make Gacha videos and CapCut is great for that! But, whenever I try to edit or add a frame, it will say: ‘ insignificant phone storage.’ Even though I haven’t had many photos or pictures. I’ll go back and free up some space but, it will say the same thing. My iPhone storage is free and doesn’t have much. And some screen shots that were taken like 2 days ago, I can’t make a new clip. Is this a glitch or is something wrong with my iPhone?"
5,its_martha,"When I was trying to edit a video, I wanted to do a velocity edit. But I don’t have the feature and I can’t update the app. So I was wondering if you can let me update the app and let me have the velocity feature like everyone else. I will appreciate it. Other then that the app is amazing and underrated."
4,YourLocalGoogleUser,"So this is amazing! I love this app a lot! You can make clips super short, and multiple different effects that look good in videos! One issue. The app can only hold 5 overlays. I feel like it should be able to hold more. There are a lot of apps that can hold like a billion layers and this can’t hold anything over six. But otherwise it’s a very good app for editing!"
5,hhhircuheri,"This is a great app. It is very easy for me to use! I highly recommend this app for video editing.   If you would like a app that can help you edit videos this is the perfect app, I mean yeah it does have some downfalls like sometimes it does take some storage and a couple other thing but over all this is a great app."
5,CaliAngel76,"Best app I’ve seen in a very long time, this app includes very good features, effects, transitions, and many more items in this amazing app! Try it out for yourself! This is amazing! I’m not a bot ether lol. People sometimes are bots putting reviews, but I really love this app and people should use it more!      Love - //Peachie~Mochi// (Pinterest)"
5,Abbeytheicon,"I found this app when I wanted to start making edits, and it’s very easy, simple, and not confusing. The only problem is limited overlays, but other than that it’s a very good editing app that I 100% would recommend if you’re trying to be an editor."
5,puppygrl22,I love capcut it’s the best but I do wish that instead of remove background it would be something like ae where we can tap the screen and every second we can put what we wanna keep of the person instead of just doing remove background which doesn’t really work
5,skyshark106,"So this editor is positively FANTASTIC, be set free editor on iPhone 100%. However one complaint is that while recording voiceover, you have to hold down a button instead of just pressing it. Please change it to just pressing a button to start, and press again to stop."
4,JNPeterman,"I love this app but I’ve noticed that the recent updates removed some of the sound effects I used to edit my videos. I would rather you all expand on the sound effects not take any away. For example, what happened to the bike bell in the “traffic” section of the sound effects; the punch sound in “fight” and many others. Please add those back!"
5,Just_Tati,This app makes it so easy to edit I’m just 12 and can edit like a pro. You can do voice overs and make it stop at any time it has cool effects and you can find the right music for you video or picture. It even shows you where you can add some effects so I really recommend this
5,jade😍💚,"Capcut is amazing, but I have a tiny complaint. When I clearly have enough storage space to make an edit, it says I don’t. This is really annoying when I’m trying to make edits! But overall, it’s probably the easiest app to edit with and no ads or anything! Tysm capcut for this experience to edit my days away!"
5,ListenerNotForLong,"Ok so I downloaded this app so I could make the new trending roblox edit videos, and, let me just say, THIS APP IS AMAZING! I finished the edit video, and it looked SO much better than my other one with a different editing app! The areas where I cut out the video were clean and smooth, and the app had many different effects for free that I could use!"
4,*******•,Amazing app! Just should be more adjustments for example maybe try upgrading effects I know you upgrade the effects a LOT but some I’m not very interested in but hopefully this isn’t a lot to ask for but if you could add a type of shading or water mark to shade anything you adding to edit it would be very helpful if that’s fine ?
5,ttyyyree,Very good app! It’s really good and it has some good transitions. I just have a suggestion and a question. Can you add some more transitions because I make edits and I’ve been searching for apps with good transitions. But yeah I pretty much just said both anyway really good app. I use the app all the time when I am making an edit. Tysm for making this app!
5,KoolestKay,"I have been looking for something like this for such a long time! This is my dream app because it’s completely free to use and has so many choices and possibilities. Please never change this because i literally almost gave up on video editing until I found this! Thx for an easy to use, free, and fun video editing app!!"
4,yepeyepeyep,"I like the app its easy to use and its free but i cant create any new projects anymore because of my phone storage i reinstalled the app multiple times , delete stuff i dont need , upgraded my storage , restart my phone and its still full i even offload the app multiple times and it doesn't work otherwise its a great app hopefully i can create projects again one day"
4,Tjay3k,"I think CapCut is a great app and it’s very good for editing videos and especially music videos. However, for artists like me I think there should more cool and trending FX. For one, I think a trail effect would be nice, a clone trail not just light or echo. Two, a clone effect would be nice. Three, more body effects and not just fx that go around your body. And four, more interesting, trippy, and fun transitions."
5,hamzatom_ytreal,It is literally completely free and there is thousands of stuff you can use in the app that is free there zero paying their zero premium there’s literally nothing that is money in the app which I’m crazed I thought that there was no editing app like this but there is my mind is in an upside dimension with for mine blowing pieces of chicken nuggets
2,anxiety :(,Ok don’t get me wrong I love the app but for the past hour I’ve been trying to get into it and it’s no longer working everything else in my phone is working but the app it’s self is frozen and won’t let me touch anything and I have an edit there that took me hours that I’m still trying to finish I’m literally almost done but it’s not working and I’m gonna freaking cry Bc I’m gonna fail school if I don’t get this done and I’m not trying to start it over cuz I have a life and it took over 3 hours
3,Kay0706,"I love this app and imo it’s the best video editor out there, especially for the price. However, the last few days I haven’t been able to add any effects, animations, or text because there’s “no internet connection” the app says. I’ve tried multiple devices which all have internet and no luck. Apparently I’m not the only one having this issue after checking the AppStore’s reviews. Hoping you will have it fixed soon."
5,Gregory Yur meme,"I’m not one to review apps, but I can’t help with this one. First of all, it’s 100% free, which is awesome. Second, one of the most easy editing apps to use. It’s extremely user friendly. There are so many features that I can’t even comprehend it. Great for starters or people who just want to make a quick edit. Absolutely perfect."
4,sssinperwolf fan,I really like this app I got to learn how to edit and so much more but the main problem I had was when I added a audio it would glitch a lot and some times log me out of the app I got really annoyed from that happening and then my Storage was getting full because of the app and so I deleted it cuz of the storage but it was a good app 😀
5,Cocoarie101,I love CapCut sooo much it’s an amazing editing app and I love that it’s free and you can remove CapCut at the ending but I have one problem before I could reverse my videos and now I can’t is this happening for anyone else or is it just me…I just want that to be fixed but other than that CapCut is and amazing editing app and I recommend it.
5,Montse;3,"So first, Capcut is super easy to use I made a bunch of edits and videos that are too good to be true to be made by my age tbh! Its super easy doesnt really have innapropiate stuff too! Gosh you can import it too it is so easy! I love capcut! I use it for all my editing too! I have became an awesome editor just by using capcut no tutorials needed either!"
5,spinatonka,App is amazing but it would be crazy if y’all introduced away to bring after effects presets into the app and make our own presets so we can add all the effects with one button it would make it so much efficient and add 3D text and let us bring custom fonts into the app thanks
4,yourpeemommy,"Capcut is a very good app, but I am VERY concerned. I’ve realized yesterday, at the bottom of your edited video, it may have something like “11M”. One of my videos got 744M and I’m QUITE SCARED that means 744 MILLION. If so, how could you block it? I post my face and cringy things which I don’t want anyone seeing. I think the M means million, because yesterday it was 730M-735M. I’m really really scared. Please give me and answer!"
4,Ty I can get roblox now,I’m very happy about what you did but when I needed to used the graphics it didn’t work how I wanted to work and can you please fix it because I’m trying to do a edit but it didn’t work with graphics and that it keeps going back to the size when I put the picture in so can you please fix it
4,Tricks and Toys,"Hello! I’ve been using this app for some time now, and it works amazingly! It works well with quality, and I love the shading filters! But whenever I want to listen to music while editing (I use a iPhone/iPad) the app pauses my music. I’m not sure if I’m being stupid, and it’s a feature in the settings I can just turn off, but if it isn’t please fix this. Thank you!"
5,Superstore Fan :^),"the app is so good, it’s literally so easy compared to other editing apps, however my storage is crazy but that’s cause of me, CapCut should add accounts so all the edits get saved to your account and you can delete the app and re install it and the account would still have your edits!"
2,im ur mom.com,First of all this app is ok to use but it crashes its honestly really annoying and I really don’t recommend it if it’s gonna keep doing this I’m really annoyed right now because I was trying to edit a video and it said I had no photos but my camera roll is stocked so idk what’s going on but I will tell every single person I know to uninstall or don’t install this app if u don’t fix it and I will spread it around my school and TikTok so if u keep this up I’m coming for you.
3,abc it is easy as 123,"Cap Cut is a great app but when it comes to storage it acts up, for example today I was logging in and about to make an edit when I tried to tap on the creat new project it said I needed more storage when I had lots of space left , but I did as they said and tried to clean up my storage I deleted a lot of pictures and videos but it still would not let me make a new project☹️☹️."
5,twinkle✨toes✨,"I really like this app! I’m a beginner but I was able to make decent edits through this app. I use this app for all of my content. I just have one question, if I were to transfer my SIM card to another phone, will all my edits be lost?"
4,Lilychap0206,"I love this app and a lot of other people do to but there’s one thing I think you should add. In effects you should add a slide bar to adjust how much the effect is showing if that makes sense for example, I don’t really like how much glow edge glow uses so there could like be a slide bar like the filters to adujust how much it uses. I hope this made sense other than that AMAZING APP"
5,01Flopsy,"The main reason I got this is because I wanted to make gacha club shorts and also I wanted to make my cat have lips and talk 😂 but whenever I got it , I was addicted!! I was making edit after edit, tik tok after tik tok! It was amazing!! I extremely encourage everyone to check this app out because it is literally the best app on my whole phone! 👏"
5,sunlightmoon10283,The app is amazing it helps me to make Gacha life videos now because of it I have 5k without I would’ve only have 1k but still I would still be thank for I have 1k but cap cut I am about to have 6k if you have not downloaded it you have to it’s the amazing you guys just have to download it can make more then just Gacha life videos
4,124732830,this app is so good for editing but I would like too maybe add more animations at once because I want to make a bit more combos for my edits and it gets a bit frustrating when I have to keep saving and making more projects so I can put more animations so that’s a idea for any new updates that id really enjoy. Overall 4 and a half stars!
4,Alp3333,"I made some pretty good clips with this app! This would be a 5/5 for me, if there wasn’t so much glitch. After I made up to about three projects, the app just started to glitch and lag whenever I tried to edit something or add an effect. Even if I wanted to look at my precious projects it would glitch! If you could fix this issue, that would be amazing! ☺️☺️"
5,einksnwknwdknwknwdknw,First of all it’s so easy just to move stuff and second it’s so easy just to put effects or make it look third a lot of gacha tubers that are sufesel use this give this five star rating you won’t regret it there’s one thing is I can’t turn my pics into animation but everyone else can but still very good editing app
2,KSWEIK,So I downloaded this app and I have had for a while and it worked. But then all of a sudden it just stopped working. Every time there was a split in between each clip it would lag a little. Then when I have WiFi and I try to put a transition it says I’m offline or no internet connection. Here is the worst part when I export my video it legit would cut off the rest of the whole vid and give like what 8 seconds of the vid. Please fix it’s really annoying.
4,br0wnie_bean,Overall great app for editing and I love it really but I have been having some trouble lately because when I try to use options I haven’t used yet it’s saying I don’t have any internet connection even whenever I do so that’s just something that I’ve been having a problem with for the past couple of months
5,.Angel296,CapCut helpppp I thinks there’s something wrong with my CapCut okay so normally when I make my edits I use the auto velocity option which is in style. But yesterday when I went to go look for it I couldn’t find it and like the option for the auto velocity is just gone for me so if someone could help me or idk 😭
5,paogar05,I was desperate to finish a project for school and I tried multiple websites and apps that would make my video vertical but it just wasn’t happening that’s when I decided to download this app and it literally took me  5 minutes to do this video no kidding I love this app because it just saved my grade again love this app
4,KKingsi,"I’ve been using capcut for most of my edits and it was pretty good. Better than kinemaster. There is a lot of glitches in the app though, Please fix them. But other than that, The editing software is pretty good/decent but I’ve switched over to Alight Motion recently but I will still frequently make edits on capcut because its still a good editing app."
4,jsjdjdjfjfjd,"Okay, so I LOVE THIS APP!! IT’S SO MUCH FUN RO EDIT AND MAKE ALL THESE COOL VIDEOS!! but there’s just one thing… When I select some photos for the video, (I like to make gacha life Videos) everything is okay, but when I make more photos for me to add it says I have NO PHOTOS. it would really but great if it didn’t do that :l i love this app so much but they really need to fix that. I hope you don’t have to do this same thing with capcut!!"
4,LuiBiceps,I love how easy it is to make awesome videos out of any media you have on your phone. Up until recently the app has worked fantastic. As of late when I go to add sounds from my linked tiktok account the app refuses to connect and allow me to use sounds. I have to delete the app and re-install to sync my audios. Other than that I have no complaints.
5,Lol649174,"It is a very good app for starter and advanced editors. I use it everyday for simple things like making mini movies and things like that. A tutorial for simple edits would be nice or maybe an update where we can use multiple animations without having to make a new project. Other than that, it’s a very good app"
5,🦩🌸vine_sisters🌸🦩,It’s like a good editing app which is really good because I’ve been looking for a editing app that could help me like edits and cap cut was my first option I was really getting really bad but I keep moving on I wanted to quit but I didn’t thank you for Cap cut this is really great I like your app that’s why I give it a five star Reading
5,sunset prinses,First of all I love this app. I have heard so many good views about it and I just had to try it out and it’s so easy to work and use. The best thing about it is that it’s free and it’s amazing! You can make as many videos as you want and they turned out to be really good quality. I just love this app so much and it’s just amazing!!
5,Gacha Snow cookie,"its a bit complicated and probably wont suit a starter to editing pics, videos, and so on. I started off with KineMaster and that was a easy way to edit. Now I use this app and its super great and more options than KineMaster. Overall, I would reckon this app if you have patience to understand and learn."
3,aghjbewfjuiwehdiowsddjasjkxhi,The apps good and all but there are somethings that are very annoying the app is not the best there’s this thing that’s very annoying and it’s when I wanna make a edit but it says storage FULL😡 it’s so annoying i delete all my edits and it still says storage Full I hate it so much and I deleted all my pictures and saved one video to make this so CapCut can you please fix this and I’d say this app is a 3 stars sorry
5,alliecatangel,"I love this app! It’s free, and very good for making edits! The sounds are very good and the animations are beyond amazing! Bu5 I do have a suggestion, maybe you guys could add more text to speech voices because for my edits I like to use tech t9 speech but there is like no voices at all to use, there is only 2 girl voices and 1 boy voice. So, please add more voices!"
3,cappy.fire,"This app is really good for editing! However, there’s one problem that keeps occurring to me over and over again. Whenever I try to put an animation on one of the stickers, it works for a small amount of time but it stops the animation as soon as I exit out of the menu (despite it still having the line to show that the animation is still there). Can you please fix this?"
4,Fmoig: @miss_ofe_,"The app is amazing! It is a great alternative to other apps like KineMaster. Besides that, my only issue is that it take A TON of storage. It’s been doing something where it download a good 10 megabytes whenever I want to open a SINGLE project. My phone barely has any storage at all, and I really think there should be a way to manage how much the app is taking up."
5,kitty catlover love,"Hello! I love this app so much!!! It’s super easy and it’s free which makes it even better!!! If you want to make edits like the youtubers, I recommend this app. It’s an all in one app that lets you do things from add effects to make your own audio! The people who left bad reviews are karens and five year olds. Download this app today!!!"
5,Blossom_Boy147,"Dude i use this app 24/7, like, everyday! Its so amazing and i love everything about it, its so underrated. And the fact that its so good without needing to be payed for is even better!! Hardly any of the things need to be payed for, and what i do doesnt need to be payed for, i love this app so much and its my favorite, ditch the KineMaster and the PowerDirector apps. Get this one now instead!!"
5,GIFTING OUT NOW,"This is an amazing editing app, and probably the best for mobile. It has amazing transitions, no watermark, it’s everything a mobile editor can ask for. But for me can you please just remove the limit of only having 6 overlays? Or if not just make it a larger number?"
5,jackbosss,"I love this app a lot and I like animating with it. But, Sometimes when I’m animating there are different parts for the body, And when it happens I need more then 6 layers. Yes, There are 6 layers which are a lot! I use this app for editing. I give the app a 5 star review, It’s just the over lays.  At least about 10 over lays will do."
5,johannatheslothyUwU,It’s super easy to use and I make really good videos with it you can even remove the made with CapCut ending and it’s more simple than KineMaster but when I have WiFi it says when I try to put an animation it says I have no internet please fix this other than that this is a great app i recommended highly
5,Zach Huddon,So I’m a survivor host and I make edits for vote offs and I’ve tried so many apps for effects and I finally found this one! It is all you need!!! Over a thousand effects and sounds are free and they never ask you to pay for anything. I didn’t know it was possibly for it to be this good but it is! Thank you so much to the creators of it.
5,Hehnasnd,"I downloaded other apps that started to glitch and just became a black screen. But this doesn't glitch at all and it would be perfect for my videos!🥳👍🏼 But I would want it to update, for example just like put in actual music made by celebrities, that would be Better!👍🏼🤗"
4,cutietan09,I love this app but it does not really take a lot of storage for example I delete all my photos and it still says full and I’m like why will you not work and also forces me to delete the on CapCut I work so hard for and I have to delete it but overall it’s a good edit app everything on the app is very good and everything is free and no water mark
5,Smarttcb,CapCut is a very good free editing software but one of my complaints is sometimes it doesn’t let import anything and I would haft to wait 2-4 hours just be able to edit something and that’s very annoying so I hope you guys fix that! Other than that CapCut is one of the editing softwares out there!
5,🤔🤔🤔🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫,Sad to say but there is a glitch where it says your storage is full when it’s not. So anytime you close out or try to save the video to your iCloud. It will not let you save or get back in. Fix this because many others have experienced the same thing.
4,Hgirl2000,The app sometimes dose not work and I have to close out and restart the app. A ok app really easy to learn but sometimes it gives me some trouble. A couple days ago it started asking me for something I went it and let it have access to everything but it is still not working. but like I said a overall good app.
5,General Guys Guide,"Ay y’all, keep it low. Not tryna have to much competition lol. That’s how good this app is being the best free editing tool out there right now. I’ve tried a bunch already and this is the best by far. Even the free version of well known editing tools can’t compare. Honestly they’re scamming you with this app being out. Please keep it low 😂"
5,pocky_eater,"I love this app but I have a idea that will make the app better, I feel like you should add a favorite button to a transition so you don’t have to keep on scrolling back and forth and instead be able to have a option to find it right away. I hope you get to see this."
5,READ ME 🥰,If I could I would put 4.5 stars because u can’t put an account so once you delete the app u lose everything. Also it sometimes freezes and idk if that is my phone or not. I do wish there were more cool stuff (not just basic) but I love this app and made many edits
1,🤩🥳🥰🤩🥳🤩🥳,When I’m working on a video and I exit out and come back the video goes blank. And loses all the hard word I have done. I was making a video for the whole day today and it just went blank when I got back to it. I hate that all my hard work on making a video just pooped like that. And I can’t even get it back. This hasn’t just happened to me once. It happens to me ever single time I use CapCut. I thought it was just my internet so I went over to my friends house but it still did it. CapCut you need to fix that ASAP.
3,Gracelover346,"It’s a great app and has made me a better editor in only a few weeks. But it’s so annoying cause (this happens frequently) I was trying to do the wave 3 animation for an edit, and I kept putting it to fast, but whenever I pressed the check botton and watched it, it was going fast and kept replaying! I was literally trying to fix it just now and I’m about to delete the app. Capcut pls fix this"
5,Dsmpfan789,"I love this app no doubt, but it takes up way to much data like a lot.I can’t even delete the app cause all the data would be..so if you could add a mode were you can (optional) your email to log in and see your saved edits. Thank you for taking your time reading this. ☺️❤️"
4,awkward.frappy,I love the app and I use it a lot but there is one bug I’ve noticed which gets extremely frustrating. I connected my tiktok sounds to it but after I close the app I have to uninstall it then install it back to reconnect my tiktok account. It’s very annoying to do. Other than that the app is great to me. Just would like the bug fixed.
5,Helloimjacks,"I use capcut alot and i love it! Its so useful for editing clips! Capcut is a really good editing app! ✨🤗 The only thing yhat i really want is if you can add a like feature where you can freeze the video for a second like funimate does, if you can do that. That would be amazing! 🤗 thank you capcut for your amazing editing service ❤️"
4,UnderWolf10,"I love this app and have used it for almost a year and was super excited when graphs were added! I’m amazed that all of this is 100% free to use! However, there is one problem: slow-mos. I’ve seen velocity edits on vsco and videostar and they turned out gorgeous whereas CapCut makes it look really choppy. No hate, but PLEASE  PLEASE add a way to make slow mos smoother and not go frame by frame. Thanks!✨❤️"
5,Hamilton182,CapCut is amazing. I’ve used it for a while now and I can confidently say it’s gotta be one of the best video editors out there. There’s so many options for what you want to do with your video and it’s so easy to use. The interface doesn’t take that long to get used to either.
5,kaylah.ss_,i love this app. i use it for my edits and it’s the best app for it. other apps make u pay for most of the different effects and everything but capcut gives you so much to work with for free! 10/10 recommend <3 i love that they add more effects and transitions as well! i’m always excited for what will come out.
4,AlexisCheshire235722,"Hi, so I tried using Capcut for my videos and I think it’s really good. It has a lot of great effects…could work on the Chroma Key and Background Remove features a bit…and I think it’s okay. But is it okay if you can improve the quality of the videos? The videos I export and save always end up blurry and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Much thanks!"
5,😋😋😋😀😀⭐️⭐️,"an amAZING app, even though im a little confused with it, if your looking for something nice and simple this is the one. I have been using this app for a year and i approve of it. I havent used too much editing apps before, so i hope if you get this you enjoy it  From- Someone you will never know 😋"
4,carlykittymi,"Capcut is a really good app and I’ve been making TTSEGC with it and my channel has been growing! It has all I need! But, there’s one problem. I just updated my storage to 200 and it says I don’t have enough storage. I deleted and reinstalled it 3 times and it didn’t work. If you fix  this, five stars are coming your way! Thanks for reading."
5,Evopete,"Please please please help.  This app is my favorite and the audio gltich is absolutely killing me right now.  Iv tried everything. Uninstalling and reinstalling and updating my phone (iphone 12pro) please help. I love this app to much to use anything else, but there is nothing else"
5,Prickzii,"I think capcut is such ana amazing app. My one ggestion is to have motion blur with a key frame, for example, if you use a key frame to go left to right, it would have a blurred motion while going left to right. This would make things a lot easier and even better in my opinion!"
5,alaabazian,"I suggest you make more well effects such as ghost effect, velocity, and more. also put a like amount thing so if you want to use the effect once or multiple you get to choose, other than that this is a great editing app!!:)"
5,RinaBop04,"Everything about the app is great! I use it to make edits all the time. The only thing is i just wish it had a place where you could retrieve deleted edits. I slipped up and deleted a few on accident, one of which took me DAYS to complete. Other than that the app is wonderful!"
5,Opossumssauce,Man it’s amazing I use this app a lot because it’s easier to use than other apps and it features more definitely 5 stars you should download this app it’s completely free to and it’s very easy to figure out so go download it if not then it’s cool have fun paying a lot of money for scams cause this app is the opposite of a scam
4,elenaunicorn772,"I have tiktok and I always make videos of roblox and I was looking for an app and then I stumbled apon CapCut. CapCut is a very useful app, and I love it a lot! I feel like it could use a little bit more features though. When I do overlays for the video and press remove backround, it barely shows the video. That could use some changes, but overall CapCut is amazing!"
5,fjfj ekdnsodbfksh,A great app I use it everyday I love how much work you guys put into this instead of these other guys it stands out the most that what makes it the best in my book only thing I want in this app is a floating emoji intro that would be so cool so you can place it as the canvas behind a video that would be really cool🤙🏽💕
5,It resets everything,"I have used multiple video editors in my time, as a person who also posts them, I've seen the best quality and most people liking capcut edits. No watermark for FREE the transitions are GOOD you can extract audios from recordings and screen recordings and I LOVE it! I recommend this app 100% with custom slo-mo speed up,and the other things I named, Capcut is amazing!"
5,the shadow panda,this a really good app in my opinion honestly i’m pretty new to editing and this was really easy i already made 3 edits and my freinds are giving them a good 9-10.  i’m not like a “pro” so there might be flaws but for now i would say “good job 👍🏼😊”. but there is one concern it would be really cool if there was a feature were we could share our edits in the app this would probably help other people gain ideas also it would be nice if there was a way could “apply “ dark mode because some people just like the appealing of having dark mode on for instance me.  any ways good job and have a great day/night ⭐️🤍✨
5,BtsAlana210,this app is amazing! Better than any other editing apps! I really love it! Its the only app i use for editing. Theres actually nothing wrong right now. Its really useful! I just havent been using it for months because i just get really bored and lazy. But still its amazing but i think i might get back into it! But nice work on this!
5,bxcka✨,Can y’all ad overlay effects cause I want to use effects but only on my overlay pictures cause normal overlay doesn’t go on effects I seem to have the newest update but how come I don’t have shake 2 cause I seen another editor who uses this app use is but I can’t find it
2,AmusedTuna,So when I try to do a sound with the beat feature I noticed that when you press it to fast it deletes the beat and it was annoying and maybe I was asking if you can move the delete button somewhere else like make the delete button have it own button not with the “make new beat” thing please I want you guys to make please do it because it messes up my video with the sound I beg you
5,betty mc spetty,"The app is great!! But for some reason, when I try to add an overlay, use effects, use filters, it just won’t work for me. I could add transitions and other things but these I really need for videos and editing. Please fix this when you can. Thank you!"
5,Moni1013,"This app is incredible, but when I make edits and I export them to my camera roll, the video is not the same. It does the beginning of the video but then after like 5 seconds it just freezes for the rest of the video. If you can fix the bug that will be great!!!"
4,444 iaaaassas,"Hi , I’m here to ask why did you guys take the  style button away where you can find the velocity effect? I’m just here to say can you please put that back on it’s hard to do regular velocity when you guys just made a simple tool for it but everything else is great I’m just disappointed."
5,Mashett Itunes,"Love this app, I saw an add about it on TikTok, and I needed a new editing app so I downloaded it and it was actually really good. Usually every editing app you need to buy something to get all the cool accessories and stuff but this for free is LEGENDARY and I made some epic montages on it and it looks really nice. Super easy btw would recommend downloading."
4,bitlife sniped wolf fan lol,Every time I make a smooth velocity on capcut it comes out weird. It doesn’t go through smoothly as it should. I exited out and go back in and it’s the same thing. I even export it and it still comes out glitchy. This has recently started and I don’t know why because it never did this until now
5,lane is so cool and ama,This app has been doing great you have added so many new features that help like smooth slowmo and graphs this app is great for beginners but some editors might want more from this app so you could ad motion blur this really helpful for some editors that want more from this app!
1,Pxeachy,"FYI, I HAVE BEEN EDITING FOR SIX YEARSS!! I have never seen a worse app for editing like this one. Firstly, The chroma key option is broken and you are basically unable to do anything with most of the applications on here as they crash. Majority of the time the app crashed unexpectedly or I have to delete 1,000+ photos for it to work. The amount of space a single edit takes up is outrageous. Use funimate instead, it’s much better and you can actually get stuff done. I’m very dissatisfied.              - a sad and sour editor"
4,cute girl uni,Okay so I have downloaded many… I mean many Editing apps and I found the right 1 it’s basic it’s easy but you guys should reconsider adding more tik tok songs for those who don’t have tik tik it’s no cr tho other apps make you buy songs for money this 1 gives you a few songs but add songs like Good 4 U or Blinding Lights or Face Off or u know?
5,capcut rocks,So I love cat cat but there’s one problem about it there is one button that doesn’t work in the whole app and its style I’ll try to do some things on cap cut but it says it doesn’t work but I only need one and it’s the 3-D edit right next to the big head so can you please enable that thank you🤘you rock
3,by hiba 5,So basically mine wasn’t working so I tried to delete it and re-download it but when I did it started loading so I waited about 5 min and nothing happened so I closed it checked an hour later still was loading the next day I checked it was still loading this is the 3rd day of me trying so if you can do something about please help me because I love this app.
5,zohaibmasood,It is a fantastic app. And the best part is that it is free. There are a few suggestions that would make this app greater.  1. There are bunch of effects but we can’t use masks on them. We cannot put blur/rgb effects on specific part on the video.   2. We cannot use mask on texts which would be a great inclusion.
4,prrrfekt,My friend Told me about this app it is amazing I love editing pictures into one big edit the shortcut the function is my favorite function in the app but if you want to become a content creator I would not recommend this for editing your videos because I've tried and it's not my best so I just recommend to do an edit small edits and not very big edits.
5,🌴cloudy😏🦋,So I am a editor for some stuff and I love using this app because at first it was a bit difficult but I ended up figuring it out but I do have a suggestion do you think you can make the quality a bit better if not that’s totally fine 🤩.
5,Kimstergirl,I love this app! And I am very picky about editing apps.  I have tried so many apps that work great at first but then stop working. CapCut was not like that. I have been using it for a while now and absolutely love it still. Also it is completely free. You need to download this. You will not be disappointed.
4,Rexynne,"CapCut is a very Great App! I used it and started the blow up a bit- Mot a lot but I was thankful, I feel like it could use more updates, not like it’s laggy if that there’s bugs- But in transitions and things to edit to your videos- ( If they did update and add new transitions then sorry because I haven’t noticed yet 😅👌)"
5,Unicorn_Funppep,I downloaded this like 2 months ago. Its all free. But the one dumb thing is that since I make edits all the time I’ve had to redownload it twice cause it would always say that I need more storage in camera I delete stuff. Still says this same thing Please update that if you can!
5,poopppppokyrg,"You don’t have to pay for anything as far as I know, and you can even delete the water mark at the end. And if you don’t want to you dorm have to have a watermark smack in the middle of the screen! I would definitely recommend it if your just getting into editing like me!"
5,EricaDiane,I absolutely love this app! I downloaded it today and have no complaints. It’s so user friendly and everything makes sense. I didn’t get frustrated like I have on so many editing apps before. This one just works. Thank you so such a wonderful video editing app!
4,killluagoddie,"I’ve been using Capcut for a while now, my only complaint is when it says “no space on phone” or something like that, I get that I have no space on my phone but it doesn’t mean I shouldn’t be allowed to not make more videos! I should still be able to make videos but not be able to download them!!"
4,_Nerdy_Girl64,"I love LOVEEEE CapCut, and I stand by it as my main video editor. I love it so much that I only really have one small bug about it. I wish the app had a feature to import custom fonts for the text option. If that were implemented, I wouldn’t have to switch between 3 or 4 different editing apps. It’s a small complaint, but would make things 10x easier."
5,KALAMBFAM,"This is a great editing app but every time I tap on the app button it logg’s me out. It is not connection problems, because it says I have full connection.  Since that happens I can not make my edits anymore, so if you have any suggestions on how to fix it pls tell me. Thanks!!!"
4,saarahaidary,"Hello! THIS APP IS LIKE THE BEST!!! Really I use this app all the time! But the problem is I can’t use it anymore because my storage is full, I wanted to get it on my laptop/computer and there’s a website to get it but that might give me a virus, so can you please add capcut to MacBook air AppStore and every other device? Thank you! I really appreciate it. This app is the best! Continue adding more cool features"
4,Master.Of.Reviews,"I use it a lot for my editing, and its really good but a few problems I think should be resolved:  1. Whenever the app closes or anything the project is already saved but the green screen and audio moves further on the video and it messes me up.  2. The remove background feature stopped working for me and just removed me instead."
4,Hxhdhfb,"It’s a great app and I use it for all my videos! But whenever my storage is too full, it’ll give me the notification which is understandable! And I go to my photos to delete it and clear up space to save the video. But in doing so it deletes the video I was  just working on. And it gets really annoying. Overall great app and thank you!"
4,crossbonesmcc,"Overall it’s a really good app, the only problem I has is that when the app updated all of the text on my edits stoped working and it make me “install update” or something like that every time I opened an draft that I made before the update. Otherwise all the app functions well for my uses and is fairly simple to use and figure out."
5,savkz,"So I’ve tried like video star, i think it’s called? Oml I can’t figure out what to do. There is so much things on it and no tutorial. Then I tried capcut. There isn’t a tutorial but I figured it out really quickly. It’s well organized and you don’t need to pay for anything better. I RECOMMEND FOR ANY EDITORS"
4,potterhead.reviews,I love this app but sometimes when I leave the app while I’m still editing I will come back and try to press anywhere on CapCut but everywhere freezes on my screen and I’m not able to do anything but I’m able to press anywhere out of the app. Is kid it’s just me that this happens too but if u can plz try and fix it ty
5,jasonhayer,I love this app. It is great for any use. There is one problem though. Whenever I use my music in the videos it stutters and sometimes go silent. But when I upload it the music is perfectly fine. Setting that aside this is a great app and would totally recommend.
5,Duckhead #2,"Ok, this app is why I’ve been doing editing. All the features are free and no watermark, unlike apps where you have to pay 14 dollars just to remove a small logo. I love all the transition features and possibilities. And you can change the text on the ending. Added bonus. Wonderful app 😊"
5,caaats!!!!,"Love CapCut, but.. when I was editing it changed to a whole different language for the effects like some of it was English and most of it was a whole different language. Then I was going to write this review then saw update, now effects are back to normal but like why did it do that??"
3,ItzJadeEgames,I’ll make this short and simple it’s an amazing app  transitions great layers but the one thing that makes it terrible is that I have a bunch of photos that I use but when I go to use them they say I have no photos so I go to a new project then go back to the one I was working on and then it still won’t work so I have delete the app just for it to work again and the quality could be better.
4,EfrainM47,"this app is honestly awesome and i’m loving it it’s just one thing. the importing of videos. i will click one or multiple videos and when i click add it says “couldn’t import” even if i close and reopen the app. please please fix this and if you do this will be the best editing app but other than that this is awesome, but please fix this major issue"
3,KQMReview,Trust me I love this app it really helped make my videos better but you can do things to make this app legendary. Like adding a Pro mode with a more professional format and looking at computer editors so that you can add things to make this app better. Also you can add ar and vfx in the pro mode and add an overlay option that locks it to the clip that you’re on. So great already but it could be legendary. (Look at Adobe premiere pro)
4,Jellyfish 🧶,"So, I was and am a middle class in editing. Over all it’s an awesome app for editing but when I’m trying to edit, I clicked all the photos I want to use but when I press import it say try again. This happens almost every time I want to make an edit. If you could fix this issue, I would be delighted."
4,thatkindasusmyguy,"Many editors have a sorta reflective ground, kinda giving off a reflection, like they are standing on water. It’s called shaders. It makes their videos look 1000 times greater and more edited. But the tutorials are a lot of work, and I’m giving a big thumbs up to you guys about the Auto Velocity style. That is 1000x more easier. So keep up the good work. ⚠️THIS WAS NOT TO CRITICIZE ANYONE⚠️ ❤️"
5,gvkhxvngcfyihrdsv. cccjtss,So fun and easy to use. I’m very new to editing and this helped me a lot with starting off. There are some minor bugs but that’s not really an issue. The only thing that I don’t like is that I cant listen to music while I edit if there was a way for you to fix that please? Thank you!
3,Stormy Weather 168,"I have internet, I love this app but lately it hasn’t been working AT ALL. I’m in internet and it says I’m not, I have to redownload all my work and a lot of it won’t download so I can’t even access it. I’m a blooming YouTuber and this is extremely problematic. Could you PLEASE fix this? It’s annoying and I love this app but my experience has been going down hill for a while now and nothing I do to fix it works"
5,Lola Kay H,"hi, CapCut. i have some filter suggestions. The filters on this are absolutely amazing. and the camera thats on it is so smooth and awesome! But heres the part, i think there should be more filters for us. like snapchat, and some more fun filters. thanks for reading!! 💖"
4,AmaZeBlaZe,This app is amazing for editing and making it super easy to to do everything but the only thing that bothers me so much is that it wont let me use my Saved Tik Tok sounds for some reason I don't know if it just me but i uninstalled twice and still the same thing and for that i rate it 4/5. But if anybody has any suggestions please help !
1,TruexGhostly,So I only made 2 videos so far with this cause I loved the idea that I can transfer my TikTok sounds over and make the edits. Unfortunately for both times I had to delete the app and download it just to make the video. It doesn’t add all audios and after I finish one edit it will just say “can’t connect to internet try again” and no matter which WiFi I use or my data it never loads unless I delete the app and redownload it. I’ll just stick with my last editing app until this is resolved
5,zayner12,"hey. this app has been a good app that has helped me edit. i actually don’t use capcut for editing instead, i use it for watermarks, overlays, etc. this app is a very good app for starters and helped me on my earlier editing days. i don’t know what’s wrong with my capcut, but i haven’t been able to find the clean slow-mo feature. i’ve re-downloaded the app and still haven’t seen it. most my friends who edit have this feature so i don’t know what’s wrong with my app. please help!! other than that i really recommend this app for new editors or editors who just want to have fun."
5,Capcuteditor,Hello capcut you should really add a pinch effect and you should add where to you can put where you can layer 2-3 animations on a clip it would really help then exporting or if you can’t could you maybe add an pinch animation in the middle of the screen just like spin out but no spin pls and thank you for your time W editing app btw
4,Hey_thats_me😐,"I love the app, I have no problem with it but I wish there was an option to turn on dark theme on the main page where your edited videos are. if you can please add an option to turn on dark theme, that would be great. But other than that it’s a really good app, I recommend it. Keep going a good job.👍"
2,read very important revuew,"I use CapCut around the clock as a editor, but I’ve had a few bugs. It’s easy to use, but I’d like to know why won’t it let me download!? No it’s not due to my storage, because I’ve already downloaded it before, then deleted it. So as I download it again, it simply loads, and then does’t do anything. I’m wondering if there has been other reviews saying this, if there are please fix the bug. Overall, it’s a good app. -A random 8 year old editor"
4,Z3roPh!x,"i appreciate this app very much. i am a member of many communities and making small 30 second edits of them only takes 15 minutes once you get the hang of it  when you export the video when you’re finished, it has an automatic feature where you can choose to post your video to tiktok, instagram, etc. it also has no watermark! i’ve downloaded so many apps which removed the watermark but at a cost. this is amazing.  it also has a feature called “shortcut” where it makes an edit out of 15 images or less. animated transitions and audio is all done for you! (the shortcut feature has a watermark, unless you upload it to tiktok)  it also allows you to extract audio from videos for free.   the only thing i dislike about this app is that you can’t import audio files from your files on your device. i think it would be an amazing feature to add.   overall, it’s one of the best editing apps on mobile and i would definitely recommend it to beginners and experts at editing!  4/5 stars :)"
5,OnePursuit,So I loveeeee this app it’s great for YouTubers  But it has some bugs and lacks some good transitions and it would be amazing if it was collaborative so that your friends could edit with you live but overall a great easy to use app one more thing I would add pro color grading and better music
5,isaacnooby,This is an amazing editing app but there is something that you should add its basically adding animation to a photo you have many effects like the 3d zoom for example its kinda like that but if the picture is moving and i have to add a separate app to do animate the photo
3,Cdogg008,"This app is great, there are so many things you could do when editing videos on this app. The only problem is that if you trim at playhead so many times in the same place of a/the part of the video(s), the app starts to lag and you can’t see the progress you made in your editing when playing the video(s)."
4,purple ice cream,"All in all, CapCut is a great app. But there are some things missing that really need improvement.            When you try to make a video slow motion, it makes it glitchy instead of smooth. Which bothers me, personally. And if I make a clip that’s about 0.1 seconds, it won’t let me make it longer or delete it."
4,escotags,I really like this app but when I try and edit it sometimes glitches and pauses my edit I tried saving it and it won’t work and I have to redownload the app but I don’t want to loose my progress even tho I only started this app just yesterday but overall this app is really good lt has amazing effects and it’s really easy to use and I really like it
5,Meliah <3,"I’m in love with this editing app, most apps i’ve downloaded to edit they’ve always made me pay for extras. This has good quality can be a bit laggy. Great filters & Stickers. It’s good at slowing things down or making things faster. The animations are amazing. Etc. Either all I love this app 10/10. :)"
3,bob ross✍️,I think cap cut is amazing really easy to I spent all day making an edit but now it’s telling me I have storage issues so the made me mad cause I have a tablet anyways so I sent all the pic to my phone and deleted everything in both my phone and tablet but it still says I have to clean my storage and won’t even let me look at my edits I would rally appreciate it if that would not happen
5,susan00000000000000000000001,"The app lets you do fun cool edits you can do edits of people like yourself ,friends and celebs the app is very easy to use I found out about it by tiktok same as funimate but really I’m not gonna pay money to make edits CapCut is the best edit app I ever used and ever will use this app definitely deserves a 5 star rating and no need for fixing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
5,GamergirlGameaddictedperson:>,"I absolutely love this app!  All it’s transitions and kinks and it’s quirks!  But one problem stands out to me, which is that the audio or music on my videos seems to crash when I add even one sparkle effect, which causes problems along the way with the entire sight crashing within itself.  Overall, no other complaints, so if you’re reading this questioning if you should get the app, then yes. I highly recommend it. I just don’t know if the team or whoever can fix this issue if other people are having it, like I said I don’t know.  Thank you and have a good life."
5,bbbbbbHIddddddd,"I recommend CapCut.  CapCut is very easy to use and many good effects. As a GachaTuber, I love this app and make all my edits and videos with it. It’s also very good for beginners.  I would like to be able to organize my projects though. I want to be able to put them in groups like my Gacha videos, edits, and music stuff."
5,uninaomi,This is an amazing app 10 out of 10 but it could use a little more improvement. When there is the three dots next to your project and you press them I would recommend a save to photos option to get the project in your library.
5,Naylen Reagan34,"This app is so good!! I have tested a lot of editing apps and none compare to this, no watermark, amazing stuff to edit with and very easy to use 10/10 would recommend to everyone of my friends my channel is NayBlox if u wanna see a example I will have a video up soon Roblox V.S Real life and I am using cap cut for it"
5,Tion Dudley,This is my first ever review and as and video artist this app is AMAZING. The amount of edits you have in this app is amazing andddd ITS FREE YES FREE. A lot of photo editing apps require you to pay and who likes doing that. Beside from that matter it is really well made and the effects are my favorite parts now I can make the logo images I always wanna make!
5,ᖇEᐯᗯIᗯE,Tbh I just downloaded this app because my friend showed me and It’s so good of an app! :D There’s no bugs what so ever and it’s great to make lots of edits and fun videos!  I really enjoy this app even tho I only done had it for a day- but from the very first video I made it works really well. And you should mostly get it too trust me you will be happy UwU
4,W3irdoNatNat,"okay so CapCut is a GREAT app! I love using it for ALL my edits and it’s just amazing, it I rated it 5 stars because for these past few days, whether I’m using data or my Wi-Fi is good, it will say “no internet connection” on certain things and stuff, I’ve restarted my phone, tried to update the app, and have deleted and reinstalled the app but it is T working. pleaseeee fix this!"
5,the_dar wolf,It good app but sometimes when I edit I add effects but whenever I expose it it made my screen froze and whenever I deleted the app it still do the same thing and when I deleted again with no effect it still work? But when I put effcet again it just but it froze...?
5,NotArlynRose,I love this app it’s the best app I have ever used but when I was using it I wanted to add effects and stuff but when I clicked on one it said “ no internet connection connect to internet and try again “ but I know for a fact that I am connected to my internet and I don’t know what to do.
4,Mynameisstupid,"I’ve been using capcut for like a month and it’s a really good app, but the one thing i really hate is the no internet problem and i keep getting it even though i have really good wifi, i would love it if you could fix this (this would also help me not struggle on this app🥲)  thank you 😊"
2,SuazGaming,Capcup is my number 1 favorite editing app but ever since the last update it’s lagging and bugging. Whenever I add an effect it doesn’t show on the timeline but it’s there. Also some playback bugs. Note that I’ve always been using in on my ipad pro. I love this app and I highly recommend everyone to use it since it’s easy and also you get the best quality. I will give 5 stars once it’s fixed. Thank you for such a amazing editing app.
5,Buttface2001fun,I would appreciate if you guys could direct me to where I can find it?:) I love to use it for my photos across my social media platforms which also helps me earn money. I’m willing to pay for a membership with the high quality value this app produces!:)
5,RiverSauceLikesGasStationIce,"Short and sweet, I was looking for a free video editor, and I saw CapCut, downloaded it, and have been using it for months, it’s got all the features that editing softwares that you have to pay for have, and it’s simple and easy to use, 10/10 would recommend!"
4,Kreizorin,Whenever I leave CapCut for a few days and come back and try to add an audio from tiktok in my favs it always says “My internet connection is bad” or something like that and it wont work until I take the app off and dowload it again I don’t know why it’s like that and I usually always have my wifi on? And it’s good it’s just CapCut…
4,Caden lem,"It’s amazing and I totally recommend, I would love to give it a 5 star but I just have one concern and that’s it. It’s the slow-mo. I know this editing app shouldn’t be for like montages or anything but it’s just the slow-mo isn’t smooth. An example could be like VSCO how the slow mo is like tracking the motion, but CapCut seems to do it frame by frame so I struggle with velocity edits"
3,𝘚𝘶𝘯𝘧𝘭𝘰𝘸𝘦𝘳,"I like this app it’s really good for editing if you know how to use it but for some reason when I use the graphs it goes out to show the whole picture when I zoomed in, it used to show the effect with the picture still zoomed in but now it just zooms out and I don’t like it. Maybe it’s a bug with me but I need help it’s annoying having to re zoom in because it keeps zooming out."
3,hijdusjysjshsuksjsjmsks,Ok so this app is amazing you can add backgrounds and stuff like that it’s just that why is the background blurry like I mean really😒 its blurry and you can’t see it well so that’s the only problem also plsssss allow have more overlays like I would like to there not be just one overlay also plsss allow more songs like the songs are just tik tok songs and like just allow more songs pls.
4,🌙Shelby🍊,"I’m trying to make a Fnaf Gacha security breach edit thing and Its not loading when I do the shortest I can do for “Animation.” I’m making my AU’s Rotate and its not working for multiple and I went back to other ones and it works for some reason! I Dont know why its doing that, it might be that I need to update it, but I don't know."
4,Kristinakutz,So I love the app 💕 But it’s sometimes kinda laggy and it’s pretty hard to edit pretty hard 😢 So I would recommend you could 1.add some more animations especially in out. 2. Like maybe some more filters I mean maybe y’all can come up with something? 3. It’s great but about the glitching part I’ve seen that like hackers or sum PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE!But otherwise it’s amazing 🤩!<3
4,I'm not strawberry milk,I fell in love with this app but there’s is one major issue. Today when I went one to watch a video I made they were all gone! All of my hardwork is gone. I spent a long time making these videos and now I am very disappointed. I expected my videos to be on there every time I go on the app. Can the developer please fix this issue?
4,kennime,"Occasionally when I’m trying to export a video it says error. I have more than enough space on my phone. I make sure to delete projects off of CapCut when I finish, and I make sure that the app is up to date on all updates. I honestly don’t get the problem but please fix it. It’s a great app I use it all the time-"
4,jewels Lowells,"I love this app, but I always wanted to do a smooth velocity edit. I’ve tried once before do a velocity edit with the custom speed. It didn’t turn out so well. Please add a velocity option. It would be really helpful. Also, I see videos saying there is a Graph option in CapCut but I don’t see it. I can’t update it. Why can’t I see the Graph option? Please help."
4,Moviepopcorn,"Capcut is really amazing. The way you can short a video down, slow it down, chop it up add zooms and stuff is really great and how you can add audios to your videos but after 3 minutes of my editing the app gets extremely glitchy and you can’t see how the videos are doing unless you just download it and see for yourself because it’s doing so bad s"
5,𝑫𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒎𝒘𝒂𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒌𝒆𝒏,The animation is super well but one day i was trying to use them but it kept on saying no internet please try again even tho I had full bars. ⟟ don’t know how to fix it! ⟟ tried deleting the app multiple times but it wasn’t working :(
5,kitkat☀︎︎,"I was really impressed because of how quickly I new all the settings. It is very easy yet very quick, and you don’t spend more than 30 minutes each project. All of the effects and animations make my editing life 12x easier."
3,layla.101.09,so each time i edit it comes out good most of the time. but on various occasions it pauses and wont play until i exit my whole edit. i have updated it and it is updated to the most recent update but still the same problem... so i am only able to play it once then after i play the edit it pauses itself and it wont play until i exit the whole edit. capcut please fix👽🙄
5,butter2hardd1,when I first downloaded this it was a little confusing but when I deleted it and downloaded it back again it was helpful and you get to use everything for free without the watermark love it keep it up : 💜 and I don’t even do reviews or rates on apps so you know this app good .
3,Raiderdog29,"So as a Gacha person I wanted to make an intro so I went to Gacha and made so photos then I went to CapCut said I needed to “Delete “ some photos I’m oh ok can’t be to hard to I delete like 5 photos and videos when back on still not enough, i’m like huh?? Alright I go back Delete more bro I only have 30 photos left and just deleted most I fav videos that I loved!!!!! What did this app do!! And it’s still not letting me do my intro!! 😡"
5,Nero6014,Overall this is a good app but there is a glitch/bug. When I add anything (like effects to text and stuff) it says “no internet connection please try again”. AND I HAVE GOOD INTERNET!!!!!! Please fix this!!!!! —————————————————————————————— Edit from developer response: Thank you for fixing the bug. Now I will give you 5 stars instead of 1.
4,"emme, tt editor","I love LOVE to edit on this app, but your wondering, why 4 stars? Well recently just today, i figured out that the thing “style” has disapeared, i was like ok, they probaly updated it, or its a glitch , so i reset my tablet, and it was still gone and i was like okay update thats when i get on here and saw that theres no update.. try to fix?😕😭"
4,CrazyCatLady2🐱,CAPCUT IS SO FREAKING AMAZING. One thing that I always hate is that you always need storage for CapCut. I always delete my photos and videos and everything but it still says I need storage. But other than that I love CapCut it’s so easy for beginners! *hours later*I deleted half my pictures and half my apps. Still don’t have storage. I changed my mind.. hate this
4,gghhghghgh,I really really love this amazing app but there is some unknown issues.. it’s been telling me my storage is low and stuff but I deleted my apps and photos and everything and bc of this I can’t make a single video and my followers are geting very sad bc i haven’t been posting without my videos I can’t do anything so idk what’s going on plz fix it
4,Greatist game ever!,I use CapCut to edit my video’s because it’s easier to use than KineMaster but the problem that I’ve noticed is that now when I register a screenshot to be 0.1 seconds it doesn’t show it like if it isn’t there and until this problem is fixed I’ll be using KineMaster though it’s harder to use and not free.  -Lion(Chris)
5,🌈✨🧚 MY KEY 😵🔑🧚✨🌈,"I used to edit on funimate, but when I found out about capcut, I never stopped using it. I’ve been using capcut for almost a year now, no complaints. 💞 I can’t wait for future updates! I’ll be here for all. Thanks for giving me such a memorable experience. 💞"
1,"hnkuyhgeqacnppim,","So I’ve done like smaller editing like 5 minutes or less, but the moment the project is longer than 10 minutes the app starts acting up. I’ll try and import audio and it’ll straight up be muted and I can’t change it. I’ve imported the sound once fine then when I need it again it imports muted. Furthermore when I save the file to come back to it in the morning half the files will be muted or blank if it’s video. This app cannot handle anything bigger than a tik tok or fan cam"
5,yesdolphinyes,"This app is my #1 recommendation for a editing app. I make the coolest edits on here! I would enjoy if I could draw on my edit and animate it. Another thing, for Text to Speech, could you add more voices? That is all! This game is so awesome so if you are reading  my review and you don’t have it yet hit that download button right now."
5,Pags835,"I love this app and everything about it. That I can share my edits with my friends and they can share theirs. But I do have one request, I’m a kid with no social media and can’t post my videos any where, is there a way that CapCut can also have a social media feature so people can post there edits on CapCut?"
4,pitchmoon 101,I like capcut but I do have one problem and that is when I am editing a video and I want to put the vintage 2 affect but then you says that I need to connect to Wi-Fi even though I have Wi-Fi and I kept trying to put the bling affect on but it wouldn’t work and when I try to put another bling affect on it still wouldn’t work but other than that capcut is a cool app
5,xxyoungkidxx53,I love CapCut but if I screen record something to use the music is I screen record it before the music plays I can’t remove that part and have the music play from the beginning but overall I think it’s a great app
1,AkivSolo,"cw: apps promoting fat phobia and bad body image and toxicity around that  - - - i was so excited to have an editing all that seems cool but im absolutely grossed out and disgusted. i had faith, this is something atrocious and something i didn’t expect from you. will not be downloading again unless i see proof it is removed.  you have several ways you can edit a body to make it “slimmer” and stuff ? that’s really triggering and problematic ?? please remove it. this has caused pain and fueled EDs body dysmorphia and bad relationships with your body and self for YEARS. i can’t believe an editing app that EVEN KIDS AND TEENS USE promotes this. if i had this a few years ago i would’ve been in such a worse place. this is one of the most harmful things we can promote on the internet."
5,natkochesheva,It is completely perfect! Thank you for your product! But I would like to suggest to add function when I upload video from your app to camera roll I would like to have opportunity to split my project to 15 sec cuts for Instagram stories for example. Good luck guys!
5,sofiaboOMG,"So over all, I love this app. This app is great for making my gacha club/life/verse videos! But I have this thing that annoys me! When you zoom in to see the project you made, there’s like a line that shows how much you watched it, and I don’t want it to show! So please fix that, but still. This is the best editing app."
5,Bea Chermeat,This app is by far the best possible free app for video editing. I just use it to make “fancam” type videos of myself to make me feel like a baddie but im sure theres more practical ways to use it too and its a godsend that this app doesnt make you pay a subscription fee as soon as you download it.
5,Cmvflash,"I love this app and I wish I knew it sooner because it has everything a video editing app would have + YOU DON’T NEED TO PAY FOR A WATERMARK like excuse me?? How are you making money off this app? I would recommend adding like a premium system or something but anyways, I would highly recommend this app!"
5,Jordynn💕😩,Okay so when I try to edit some thing it says that I have insufficient storage and I don’t know what to do because I do have enough storage on my phone and I can make videos and stuff so I don’t know why it says I don’t have storage so hopefully you guys can you help me .❤️
5,NoTNoAh12,"Great app and amazing beginner editing app. No watermark which is a plus and many transitions and effects to use. I’m just begging you guys to let us add 2+ animations to 1 clip! It would be much easier than using 1 animation, exported it and then adding another animation. Other than that thank y’all for this wonderful app"
5,idontreallycare202,"Capcut is a really easy editing app to use, oh my gosh. Literally everything is free, and there are a lot of effects and transitions to use. You can even do simple velocity edits. I can not express how much I love this app. There is no watermark. It’s simple and cool for beginners. Overall, I love it and it’s worth it. But it does glitch sometimes, but it’s okay."
5,LOADINGGGGG.....,Okay so I 100% love this so much and there’s nothing wrong about it! But it’s getting my confused like it’s pretty easy but I’ve seen people make cool edits but couldn’t it have came with a short tutorial video? Just asking it’s okay if you can’t add a tutorial video! But I recommend this app 100% so people use this app!
3,Lightesword,"A previous functional feature malfunctions. So I can link up Tik Tok again.. but now if I try to zoom in on a video (and zoom into it say 75%) the next video segment I upload into the program, when I want to zoom into slightly to make my own transition effect, that segment now goes to 75% too and the video REFUSES to zoom out and it just is EXTREMELY irritating."
4,ket0_0,"I use Capcut for all of my edits on TikTok and stuff but I do have a problem with it.   When I export the finished edit, the audio will be off by a bit and when I watch the edit in Capcut, it's perfectly in sync. I think this needs to be fixed for all the editors in Capcut that need to have perfectly synced edits and videos."
4,hannah mon tanna,I like CapCut and it’s a good app it’s just it won’t let me have the same effects like other people because I went on tik tok and saw there was a cool effect on CapCut and I wanted to try it but it wasn’t there and I tried to update it but that didn’t work either so I couldn’t even do a good edit.
5,brialiveit,"I think CapCut is one of if not the best app for editors or just video makers who use mobile devices. The variety is honestly so good, you can add your own fonts, several effects and others. It’s also simple enough to understand and not all over the place. Love the app :)"
5,Selghandor,"All of the other apps made for editing includ in-app purchases , so you have to subscribe first if you want to have actual good effects, this app is quite the opposite, it has so many great effects and animations, and it’s really simple to use and works fast, I absolutely recommend"
5,bigsteve3400,THIS APP IS AMAZING !! Has a lot of edits to choose from and I mean they are just great and it saves in 4k!! I shoot videos on my camera and then upload them to my phone and edit them on here I love this app onlthing it could use a few more features just saying
5,꧁Aᴜʀᴜʀᴀ꧂,"It’s so easy to do stuff on capcut, no watermark too! (you have to delete it) the transitions are awesome, and the chroma key works great! I can tween easily on here, although sometimes when your tweening for awhile it starts to glitch and move on its own. But just from this app I’ve gained so much support on my edits!"
4,nyachienga,"capcut i am loving these affects you added such as the new electric light border, prauge, indrescent, fold 2, and my favorite HSL!! (FINALLY)  youve improved alot these past few updates cant wait for more but can you do some stuff about the text feature like glowing or smth like that. Also add a few quality features plz #slay"
4,Jordyn Dickson,why are you tripping🤨 like this has been happening for four days and with the new “tiktok sound thing” it always says “no internet connection” when i have internet? LIKE i just wanna edit and dont wanna waste my storage on screen recording or saving it🕺 anyways my mutual _nourii is better at editing then you on your own app bye
5,Roblox 👹,"Hello! I’m here to leave a quick review for capcut! I don’t know start off, but what I can say is that this app is amazing! It’s useful and lots of people found how to make capcut look more amazing than it seems, this app is very useful and I’m glad it’s free!   Thank you for reading this, have a great day/night! <3"
5,FlowerMxxn,"Dear CapCut…  Thank you so much,I love this I’ve been using this for over like 8 months now and I enjoy using it! This is the only editing app I use now lollll.I tried using other apps and it seems hard for me! Nothing is better than CapCut (in my opinion) so thank you very much.  From: Jasmine ;)"
4,JoyVG,Amazing and Easy to use just one small thing. When I want to do the Anime filter it doesn’t show somehow… I look at styles and still no anime button and only the big-head filter and 3D Zoom. I am not sure if this is a glitch but please fix this if you can! I will change me rating to 5 stars if you can!
5,Emma or Kiyoko,I had this for awhile and it really help because I actually understand it but sometimes theres things I don't like but its a great app but also Its sometimes says that my storage is full so I wont be able to do an edit and Id only have like 9 photos in stuff but CapCut really improves me
4,cookiecutie0113,So I updated Capcut the other day and i didnt use it because it was my dads birthday. Today i went on capcut to look at my edits to see if its missing anything. This is what it said “ This project requires updated Note that this may consume cellular data. Install Now.” I pushed install but nothing happened and i didnt get to save them in my camera roll.
1,Fatbabychick111,"At first, it worked great! However now, every time I try to download a video, it says I don’t have enough memory. But I only have around 200 photos in my camera roll and I have no saved projects. It also won’t let me upload any audios nor will it let me click to make a project at all. I updated the app and it seemed to have only worsen this problem. I was warned that CapCut acts up a bit but this is just really bad. I don’t know any other apps I should turn to but right now CapCut isn’t very good."
5,nbingr,Hi I just got capcut today and it is a pretty good app but it needs more music with words. When I went to music some  of them where in Japan and I just could never find the music I liked but overall it’s the best editing app I have seen just needs more music
3,hello12345678910://-/:::,In the beginning I loved this app it worked amazing.(I am a beginner).But now it won’t load my videos and when it does it just mixes up all the editing. I spend hours on 15 minute videos just because the app does all of this. I was happy but now I am very disappointed.  I officially hate this app I have poured my heart and soul into editing these videos and they won’t even download.
4,Russ797,"The app is great I love all of the music, transitions, etc. however, there is a small problem. At random points of the app it may lag out heavily or be unresponsive. Now this is ok at first but it happens quite frequently now. I’m not sure if it’s me or the app, overall amazing app and would have given it 5 stars yet the lag broke it for me."
5,sepe.,This is a best app for starter editors It doesn’t cost much money and the edits are free it’s really a good app to download I have tried it a lot when I’m about to edit don’t get me wrong lol. But yea this is a good start to practice there’s other ways to make edits a lot of people use it it’s really helpful. I always use this to make edits so yea!
5,uiiooi,I make funny content and don’t have much to work with as anyone who is just starting out I would 100% recommend this app you can add sounds and have close to unlimited possibilities not water mark 100% free and it’s an amazing app. Been searching for years and I’ve finally found a great app.
5,sarah_0308,"I am in love with this app. I’ve seen a lot of edits that have those cool transitions and I could never find an app to do those, but once I found out that people where using this app to edit, I had to try it! And I have no regrets about using it. Honestly this is is the best app I’ve used for my edits! 🤍"
4,DropDeadRed23,"This app is probably the best editing app i have ever used with many many different layers and stickers which is awesome. The reason i gave this a four instead of five is because sometimes when i add a lot of pictures it tends to get really laggy, which is natural but it tends to do it more with this unlike other apps. But overall it's amazing!"
3,akdjsjaomsjiiiiiii,So the app is perfect but I just wanted to see if there would be some changes like  the following: once u delete the app u can make a account  for example you make a mini movie and the app gets deleted and once you Restore the app u have nothing saved and once u can make a acc it would save ur music ur projects etc etc. That all  overall the app is good great  for videos edits etc
4,argreana,So first I think all the other things on capcut are good not bad but good but when I’m trying to get a tiktok sound it doesn’t update I mean when ever I’m going to add a audio I see tiktok original sounds and I go back to my tiktok and then I didn’t see the sounds that were there so I think capcut just means to update the tiktok sounds.
5,jxnejxjsks,"It has all kinds of features which is amazing! I’ve always been trying to find the right editing app, and this is it! Although I’m not very fond of how it goes back to the beginning of animations in combo when I go to the next clip. But everything is so perfect! I love this app so much!"
5,Cat Sim Player,"First of all, it’s FREE! And it’s super easy to understand! No tutorial needed! With this app you can make edits, videos of you tube, stuff for Instagram, ANYTHING! I LOVE THIS APP! Definitely one of a kind! There’s super cool affects that you can use and tons of cute animated stickers you can put in your videos! I definitely recommended you get this app! ❤️"
5,1223334493,This app is honestly AMAZING . It’s the best editing app I have came across so far ! What makes it better than the rest of these apps EVERYTHING IS FREE! You can add your own music you don’t have to buy. You don’t have to pay for NONE OF THE filters nor do you have to pay for the effects ! It’s honestly the best app ever!!! I truly love it!!!
4,caption adorbes,"♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ Ok, this is coming from someone who LOVES editing. And i love capcut the only things i think you need to improve are: -not being able to watch your own video with no storage left This is SO hard for me because i have no storage and i really wanna edit -not being able to import stuff Hard. -Not seeing, in the ‘let capcut allow’ or something along those lines, how to access photos Hard 2.0.

5,𝙼𝙴𝙴𝙴𝙴𝙴𝙴,I just updated it and but still does not work. Ok so it doesn’t go on the next thing so it looks like it just the same picture for a long time. I dont know what to do and i dont want to uninstall it because i made a lot of animation edits on it… Please help me fix it. I dont know what to do…
5,😞😵🏋🏾‍♀️mimi,So I just downloaded this because every video I watch has cap-cut so I thought to download it but I am not a YouTuber i still would like this. And I wanted cap-cut for a long time/when I sow my first video that got cap-cut and if you read mine thank you for reading mine!
4,nvdxbcbbbcbcbxxbcbcg,"Hai!! I really like the app I’ve had it for a while and I use it for my gacha edits! ^^ but the only problem is, whenever I put Frames super  squeezed together, It’ll lag a lot and not show  the frames I put on the screen. That’s it! it’s really good overall though!! I also like how you don’t have to pay for like literally everything!"
4,miracuaddict,"I use this app quite a bit. It’s really good and easy to use. Recently when I’ve been trying to press play or pause it either just doesn’t work or I have to tap it repeatedly. I did delete the app and reinstall it but it still is difficult. Again, it’s a great app!"
4,Things I wish,"As someone who used to use CapCut but now uses vs, there are some thing I wish it had. The to hi king I want to most is motion blur, if CapCut had that it would be the best. Another one thing I want is probably mirror edges because mirror edges + motion blur are the he best. I would say graph but in the new update we have graph! That’s all I have to say, have a nice day."
5,duduajtanggzjgsjt,"This app is absolutely amazing!  I came across this app a year ago while I was a beginner editor, so this was a big help! The tools are easy to use and the quality of the app is great.  I’m glad you don’t have to pay for effects and filters like most apps do!"
5,Malorie Reviews,"1000% better than any other editor I’ve used.  Easy to use, lots of tools, and FREE.  No watermarks, very little locked features, and more.  Can’t not even begin to explain how helpful this is.  Only thing that’s iffy is the filters but other than that it’s awesome!!"
4,da1_leira,"I really love this app. The fact that there is no watermark and that you can choose to delete the clip at the end makes it even better. The only problem I have with it is the slow motion. It seems so choppy compared to other editing apps. On the other apps, the slow motion is really smooth. That’s the only complaint I have."
3,someonerereEE,"i loved this app when u first installed it, but honestly theyre kinda doing what instagram does. they updated it and i liked the app a whole lot better before the update. it did some thing with the audio, its obvious because i went back to old videos i edited before the update happened, and the audio to video ratio was very off. miss how it was when i first installed it 😕"
2,Stella_dogo912,Capcut is ok. But some things REALLY annoy me. Sometimes when im getting a photo it says “no photos start making memories here” and i have to leave the app and swipe up at least 12 times. I NEVER have storage to create a project and i end up deleting half my phone until it works and in the start i didn't have much. Most of the time the app glitches and that really annoys me. I would’ve given 5 stars but with all this i give it 2 stars.
5,orange crayon glitch,"I can finally make quality internet videos, without having to pay to remove watermark and spending hours figuring out how the app works. Cap Cut is just amazing I got the gist of it very quickly easy and it was fun to use, very proud of the products made with this app. 10/10"
4,memel225,"This app is good for stuff you want to post on tiktok or something but it keeps telling me that my storage is full then I delete 1,000 videos or photos and it still tells me that my storage is full again and then I restart my phone and then I still talks me the same thing over and over again. Please fix it."
3,ClockLava,"Love Capcut with all the cool things it offers, but my biggest issue is that, when I put a video in, it’ll dump the video quality down A LOT. I didn’t have issues with this the first two times I made a video, but now it just makes the video quality bad in the editing part and worse when I export it.  So good app, but the quality is a hit or miss."
4,Lanetta2,I mean I love The app but for people who don’t have a lot of storage in their device you can’t really do anything and I like making the videos and stuff with all my art and stuff but I can’t really do it And you should make it where people with not that much storage can do it anyway I love the app
4,Buggys but ok,"Great app I love it I use it for all my editing and videos/props. It’s amazing. My only editing app I use it’s great and all loves he effects and stuff. The problem is, when I go to edit sometimes, it says “Insufficient storage”. I have a least amount of photos, not to much apps. It bugs me and if it’s a capcut problem fix it immediately!"
4,leah ✝️⚡️🍯🦋🧸,"I downloaded the app and was trying to make and edit while every time I clicked an option it said I needed internet. Though, all of my other apps were connected and working and I even tried reinstalling it and restarting my phone which still didn’t work."
5,𝙺𝚒𝚖𝚖𝚢!!,It takes way too much storage! But other then that it’s a very good app to edit with. It helps me with a lot of stuff but it’s hard to edit stuff cause I love taking photos but it needs slot of storage and it makes it hard for me to edit when I need storage....
5,HAYLEY✌🏻,"I am overall in love with this app! At first I was getting confused with the many ways to use it, but I have been using it for a few months and it is now super easy! You can make such amazing edits on here in such little time it blows my mind! 100% would recommend!"
5,ali_dust,It’s pretty good. I use it for editing my videos and just edits. I know a lot of people say it’s bad but it’s good the only thing I hate about it is that when you split the video I wish there was more translations like basic ones and harder ones but overall it’s good!
5,firewheel27,"I like this editing app like it’s the best one to me out there because like it has no watermark, it’s simple and easy to use!! But I wish you guys could add to where you can make the slow motion could be smooth. But anyways it’s really great editing app and keep on the good work!!"
5,michelledurrah,"I think CapCut is really advance, way better than video star has plenty of effects and things to choose from one thing you guys should fix is the video time limit, make limited orblongervthsnb15 minutes. But anyway you guys should download capcut."
5,brian095222,"I’ve been through so many video editing apps and it all has water marks or crap ton of advertisements or makes you buy a membership. But this app just lets you edit, great variety of options. Solid app, I made my car edits with it and it turned out great!"
5,BrandonBBoi,"This is literally one of the best editing apps I have ever used! This is so simple and awesome. I edit for my friends and they want to know how I edited so good. I said that there is this app called ViaMaker and that the editing on this app is so simple, and if you do it just right, your final product could look amazing!"
5,Nin_la_buscadora,"I love this app ,but at the 1 week of using it. The app stared pausing and it won’t even let me finish one of the videos. It keeps stock. I thought it was my phone but no. If y’all can help with this technical problem I’ll be ok. I love the app. And I’m not gonna take it off my phone. But it freezes."
1,lov3errr45678,"This app frustrates me and has disappointed me. Everything goes good until it comes to the end. I’ve done many videos on this app and there’s times where the app glitches so badly! And I just finished a very important video and it is due today, every time I click on the video, the app kicks me out! I’m so infuriated and upset. I worked on this for almost two weeks! Please fix the issue. If not, it’s time for me to find a more improved app similar to this one, which is very unfortunate!"
4,Ashylee00,"I love Capcut because of all the unique effects, fonts, and tools it has like the background removal (which is SUPER DOPE BTW)! I like how there’s new effects being added from time to time.   Please add the 4:5 ratio for video formats!!! That is the portrait ratio on Instagram, and I usually post my videos in 4:5. It would be greatly appreciated if 4:5 ratio could be added!  Sometimes, the video would glitch when I watch it in full screen. It doesn’t affect the video when I download it, but bothers me a bit when I’m editing. Hopefully, you guys can figure out a solution to this.   Thank you and keep up the great work!"
5,🌸🌈Queen🌸🌈,I love this app because it has so many things u can do and edit and extract music.I like this app because when my best friend sends me videos I add them in CapCut and make it a cute video like in slow mow and make the I love u for ♾ meme definitely worth it! I’ve used this app for all my edits.
5,Jhen F,"Hi! So I started using the app way back in the summer and um Their is just one problem.. the transitions.. you guys can you add more key frames and make it more smooth? And Don’t change the graphs- but just make more smooth transitions keyframes also? Thank you!   Sincerely, Person who uses app-"
5,AAAAAAAAAAAAAXXXXXXXXXXXXX,Over all I love this app I’ve been using it for only 1 year and i love it only thing a suggested is that y’all should make the speed smoother bc its really chunky or laggy so I would recommend making the speed smoother but other than that I don’t got much to say!
1,Rainbow turn,"Hello! I love this game and how I can make some good gacha life vids , The things I don’t like is that the storage is bad it always tells me that I have to much storage, and the internet is bad I couldn’t even make a gacha vid ! Today I was gonna make a gacha vid and then it said,”Couldn’t import”, which I didn’t like I tapped on the photo and said no internet connection, I checked my internet and it was on! So I waited a day but did not work . So I hope u to update it! But besides all that it’s fine game."
5,remirainbow20,"Hello I have been playing this app for a month probably but now it says “CapCut would like to have access to photos” but now that I click confirm, it sends me to settings and there’s no button for me to access CapCut to photos? If you know how to fix this please tell me!"
5,joselostx,I have been using CapCut for a while now and it’s amazing🥳 I haven’t had any problems with it it’s updates are beautiful and it’s amazing to edit videos photos and more I would extremely recommend this for editing and it barely lags at all. Five stars!💜
5,I enjoy this game it's fun,Most apps will cost like five dollars but this is free and it’s 20 times better than any other mobile editing app I’ve ever seen just look amazing literally anybody can download this for free I don’t know it’s just amazing I love it ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
4,i like eating bats,This app is a really good editing app you can add overlays transitions some animations and you have key frames but what I feel like what this app is missing the most is the graphs and things like motion blur. Otherwise it’s still good but adding those would definitely improve everyone’s editing experience
5,Geographicalgirl,"Hi! As a GachaTuber I use this app to edit my videos. This app is really good and useful, and I highly recommend it to beginner editors. This is the best editing app in my opinion because it is easy to use. One suggestion is maybe add something that makes it easier to tween.  Anyways have a great day"
4,sendymcgreg,"The app is good, there’s really no bugs I could find. But 1 suggestion is to add overlay shadows. When I add a photo as a overlay on top of my video it just looks wierd without being complimented with a shadow. Just like how your able to put shadow on text I would like to be able to add shadow to my overlays when I add a photo over my video."
4,MightyELI,This app is good there’s lots of easy ways to edit i think this app is great! There’s good sound effects and good filters and more! This app if more for beginners tho. But over time now there’s not a lot of sound effects any more or any special effects any more. Most likely copyright or somthing but i still think this app is good for beginners!
3,Cute paws❤️🐾,"So when I first downloaded CAPCUT I didn’t have a problem with storage but when I started using it ALL THE TIME it always asks me to delete something from my storage and when I want to make a CAPCUT IT SAYS “INSUFFICIENT STORAGE” it makes me throw my iPad ALL THE TIME I try reloading it,DOES NOT WORK I really don’t recommend hitting your phone/iPad on the ground but CAPCUT needs  to calm down with all this “insufficient storage” thing it’s getting really annoying.❌"
4,Amabeauty101,I know you guys have presets transitions but I kinda want graphs on this app because when I add key frames it doesn’t really look smooth and I want graphs on this app. I think this will change a lot and make this app and amazing editing app! So can you guys please add graphs for key frames I would really appreciate it!
1,fjifidjfooepakwj,"Absolutely terrible app. The fact that people payed money for this utter garbage to be advertised is shocking.   The only way to delete something like an overlay or a sticker or anything besides the video you want to edit is by pressing undo. So if you realize you made a mistake, you have to undo everything you did after that specific edit just to delete it. Also if you want to delete a split you have to delete the entire part of the video that the split covers."
5,heisizkskskskz,I wanted to write this to say that this app is the best in the world if I did not find the app I would have had so much bad edits this is the best app in the world to me and I love it so so much! I make so many edits like Roblox  and Minecraft  and gacha life even if I don’t need to use it I still use it so this is why I’m writing this.
5,KIT KAT I LOVE ROBLOX,I downloaded this and thought well just another lie underneath but oh boy was I wrong this app as made my tiktok’s so much better thank you so much for making this app and I just like making the videos so yea but I have no problem with the app and I say it’s a really really really really amazing app
4,unicornMermaidJK,This is a top notch app don’t get me wrong I love the app its just I don’t like it when I watch the videos of how to make my CapCut pictures anime I don’t see it and I am on an i ad and I tried on phone and it did not work so can you try and add the anime thing on my I pad and then I will change my rating to five stars so can you add it please
4,hehehehehehehehe 💁‍♀️,"Aloha! So I LOVE THIS APP and i use it for my channel, Glossy Lillies! NO WATERMARK, STICKERS, GREAT TRANSITIONS, so many of my fans often ask me which app i use, which is this app!  So u will be thinking, Lilly, WHY WOULD U NOT PUT 5 STARS??? Well um, the reason is the volume! Its strangely quiet for me, or extremely loud! I was thinking u could improve the volume and stuff- Developers, if ur reading this, u might be feeling terrible abt what i just said abt the volume so let me make u feel a little better :) ITS SO INCREDIBLE THAT THE LAYERS, i can tell u put a lot of effort into it!  What did we learn today? BUY THIS APP ASAP And maybe work on the volume EVERYTHING ELSE IS LOVELY 😊  Ty for taking time out of ur day to read this comment! 😁 - Lilly"
5,--FierceWolf--,"I LOVE this app so much and I’m glad it’s free. But I have a suggestion for another effect thing, could you add a slower flash effect? It would help me so much with my edits and a lot of other editing apps have a normal flash then a slower flash. So if you could add that, that would be awesome. Thanks so much!"
5,0ooDemi,I think that this app is totally good overall! NO watermark! 100% recommended for editing. The only thing I don’t like is that they need to give credit for the features that they might of copied from different editing apps example like the shakes. But I really think it’s a very good editing app!
3,sodksnjsnaa,I downloaded the app it was Amazing I loved it and don’t get me wrong now it’s a very helpful app but then it started saying “Storage full”and it got annoying because my storage wasn’t even full I got aggravated to the Point where I would delete it and download it and it would still say my storage was full but when I went on other apps it worked perfectly fine.👍🏾
5,2.0130,This is a great app there are such great tools you can use and its all completely free! You might think then oh well they have a lot of ads. NO!!! They had no ads whatsoever. Its so fun and so easy for me to use. You have to download a lot of effects though but other than storage this is the best editing app ever!
5,Mia Bella Official,"This app has the easiest tools to use, and so far from what I have seen, is completely free. I like using this for making YT videos and such, and it is awesome.   Definitely download if you are looking for an easy way to edit little clips and small videos."
4,kindlewwe,"I LOVE THIS APP! It it’s very easy to manage and all free,( i suggested adding more transitions though .)although I’ve experienced some problems. Whenever I save the video it becomes very laggy and the equality gets ruined when saved into my phone, I don’t know how to fix it, I’ve already tried deleting it etc. PLEASE HELP I really need this app!"
4,Raspberry Apple Gaming,"it is a great app 5/5 stars would recommend but just the other day it stopped working and i deleted it and re downloaded it and it still didnt work it wont let me press any buttons to add text, overlays, etc i can only add transitions but i downloaded it on my ipad and it worked fine idk why its like that on my phone"
5,Val_20090331,"I LITERALLY LOVE THIS APP!!!! It’s completely free, no watermark, AMAZING transitions, etc. I have an idea. Maybe you guys add like the squeeze effects or have the option to add squeeze to your transition like funimate added! The chances of the creators seeing this is low but it’s just an idea!! Okay but highly recommended this app. 5 stars. Bravo."
5,kawaii chan😗😙,"So, I just wanted to ask you CapCut...what happened to the anime thingy? You know, where you could change pictures and turn them into anime? I dunno if I have it or not, but I’ve been searching, A LOT for that thing...either y’all removed it, or don’t want people using it anymore..."
4,kenny157,"So the app has been working for me in the past but now whenever i try to do one of the animations, they always say can’t connect to the internet nor will anything load. I’ve gone different places and it still hasn’t worked. I’ve tried many things so i’m just confused. Please help!! thank you!!"
3,Jiajaejj,"CapCut is an amazing app but I get problems with it. There’s this one problem where it freezes throughout the edit. Its very irritating. I tried to re-download the app and other ways but it seems it still not working. Overall the app is great. I just can’t do anything because it keeps on freezing. I really hope you understand what I’m saying here, thank you."
4,aiden hummer,I’m trying to make an edit and I can’t Cause for some reason the style option is not there and I’ve tried everything and it still hasn't came back up it’s been like 3 days now and it still hasn't come back yet and I’m really frustrated and I need help
5,i just enetered rafonmo,"I used this app to edit before switching to video star when i had the money, this worked great and has premade transitions! Although i do wish there was an option to make your own transitions. But im an instagram editor ( my @ is _sh1r0u_ ) and i really suggest this is youre looking to get jnto editing !! ✨"
5,Macaroniboay,"My gosh I thought this was some scam, but it is no where near it, in fact you are getting a lot out of this app!!!! I really don’t need to say much because everyone else has already done that so imma keep it real short!! Just get it"
4,Lucky_7ski5816,CapCut is awesome I’ve used it forever but my problem is that CapCut keeps getting rid of things for example auto velocity. I’m very frustrated about that because I use auto velocity all the time and now I don’t know how to do velocity edits so please I’m begging the creators of CapCut to add back the things you have gotten rid of.
4,MyNameLayla,I love this app so much and it is amazing to edit with i edit all my videos with it and post them to TikTok they might not be good but I am satisfied with how much Capcut has helped me u can clearly see I’ve improved through my videos ( Tiktok: JustLayla_Here ) i still have some issues time to time but it is still a great app I I really do recommend ❤️😁
3,me🎞,As of right now i am very upset with this app.. i started using this app back in 2021 and it worked really well and i used the auto velocity a lot! but today i go to make an edit and capcut deleted the style thing where you get auto velocity i tried uninstalling but that didn’t work it was great until this started happening and left me very disappointed.
3,ronakndnd,"I imported a bunch of video clips and set them to a Template, and when going back into edit the clips within the template, the timeline previews do not match the clip you are trying to edit. It seems too complex for a phone to handle. I'm using a recent iPhone SE 2020 with updated software etc. I have hope for this app if it can get the bugs worked out!!"
5,𝕍𝕒𝕕𝕒♍️,I love how you don’t need premium to use the cool features! It’s really awesome for my anime edits. The only suggestion I have if possible is to be able to access the TikTok sounds without having TikTok. As I am not allowed TikTok but still would like to use the sounds. Over all a great app!
4,AJ306!!,When I was putting a overlay on or whatever it wouldn’t go on because it said try again so I did like 5 times in a row so I went to so a new one it was loading slow I had internet now I have to delete the app and make it again thanks a lot and fix it so things don’t do that kind of stuff
4,Leave me alone you a rather,"So when I play this game I made one right? I was trying to make another one but it says I can’t ,so I deleted the app and replay it, it says the same thing. When I was about to watch my own video and it says I can’t. So I deleted one video and this is the same thing. I mean it’s good enough, but please fix it."
4,Carlythepuppy,"When I try to create an edit, it doesn’t let me add photos. Only videos. Once I’ve created my project and I go to add, it says I have no photos. This is very annoying and I hope you fix this problem  Edit: I fixed the problem! I downloaded CapCut two days ago and I’m already obsessed."
5,IdentifyLevi,"To be honest, this is the best editing app I have downloaded. It’s really easy to use for beginners, even tho I have been editing for a long time, this is the perfect app! I recommend to download it. It has amazing effects and animations, and everything is completely FREE! 10/10"
4,dhncftifdjutg,"I really like this app bc it’s easier to do edits and stuff. I like all the effects and all the many stuff you can do. It was overall good however, I didn’t like the way the slomos aren’t smooth. If I ever want to do a velocity edit on CapCut I first need to slow down the video on other apps which is very annoying."
5,bedbean,I found that this app was really easy and simple to use and that I could import my own sounds I still don’t know everything about this app but that the fun of it and I can progressively make my videos better and better
5,Anaveron,This app is so amazing I love the effects and everything else but one thing you need to add some smooth slowmo it’s looks bad when you do it because it’s so glitchy your app is amazing tho 5 star love all of your work and I follow you guys on tiktok keep up the work :)
5,Kanna-Le,"I personally love this app, it truest gives you what you need for doing simple editing, and it’s even free! I would recommend this app to anyone if they are looking for something to use, it may take a while to get used to, but in the end it makes it kinda easy."
5,Kenji Cater Williams,So I was wondering if you guys could have like feature where you can make part of the video like wide. Because I like to edit on here and make videos that are somewhat funny. But I just wondering of y’all can make a stretch feature.
3,Wolfie🐻‍❄️🐼,So I have a blog and I usually make really long videos and when I edit on CapCut and I’m finally finished I try to upload it but then it denies me and tells me too “get rid of some Storage” even though I have all of my pictures and my deleted photos are gone so I can usually never upload videos unless they are short pls fix this
4,Kennedy LaLonde,"I absolutely love CapCut as an editing app I use for videos, but a problem I have is that sometimes when I press effects or, text animations and other things, it says I don’t have internet connection 🤔 when I clearly do. But still, over all it’s an amazing app to use for editing :) !!"
5,soapyleesudz,"I’m not a super experienced editor but, in my opinion, Capcut is great! You can make really good edits (there are a few limitations, but it is free sooo), there are a bunch of cool filters and effects, and there’s no watermark. The only suggestion I have is to make the stock video library a bit bigger with more overlays, backdrops, etc."
5,Shingami Turtle,Ok so I’ve been using capcut for a few months and I’ve gotten pretty good with it. One thing that I think you guys should add is adjusting the keyframe speed like alight motion. It would make editing a lot better and a lot of editors would appreciate it. Thank you!
5,kat-BLM😭✨💞,"There’s some stuff that I wish u guys added but over all u guys deserve 5+ stars for making a FREE editing app!!! Capcut devs I love you, as a child I can’t spend money on some dumb edits on these good apps I’m so glad someone thought of us children😭 thank you capcut please don’t change the app! It’s perfect!!!! Much love😁❤️"
5,Evie1342,"This is absolutely amazing! I love that it has no watermark! But, I constantly make videos and constantly have no space, so when it complains to me I can't make a video even when i have enough storage to. I hope they improve on this!"
4,Lakee B.,So this app is wonderful great but when you kinda pass the 1minute time it starts to lag cuz right now i am making a 4:00 minute video and when i shorten my clips it starts to lag but it stills shortens up the clips the way i like it so maybe can you fix that and still great app no watermark everything i can ask thank you 😁
5,KSJDNDBFBJFJF,This is an AMAZING APP I use it all the time but I don’t like it when it says your storage is full can you please change that? I’ve actually used this for like 9 or 6 months it’s an amazing app I really love it you guys should add more effects I also love the new update with the shortcut it’s really helpful
5,cufjfjrjjdjdjjs,"Hi! I wanted to say how amazing this app is. When I first tried it out I thought it didn’t really have many good transitions, but once I started to explore it more I figured out it’s a great editing app with many great transitions! (Sorry if I’m spelling transitions wrong!) More people need to use this app. Talk about underrated 😂"
5,roblox/adopt me lover!,"This game is awesome! I used to have another editing app that had nothing like this. This editing app is life changing. I always used an app called splice that you couldn’t save the videos to your camera, add  affects like these or add audio like this. Over all I think this is a fantastic editing app!"
5,jsndjd.!'s,"PERFECT. This is like no editing app ever seen! Has all the transitions I want to make edits, NO watermark! (You can’t cut that off in photos or just delete it) And, THERES NO STRUGGLE HAPPENING! This is so easy to work with and if I couldn’t find this app, I would have been still struggling out there to find a app just like this, you did well!"
5,i_dont_know_what_to_put_here,"Everything is working fine but there’s one thing that annoys me, when ever you have to find a transition (I don’t use the 3D ones) you have to scroll pretty far. So can you guys add like a section to where it says “Last used” or “Favorites”? Or even a search bar?"
4,Hyper Brayz on YT,"I was trying to use the effects on this video I was editing, but it said I wasn’t connected to the internet even though I am connected. I tried to reinstall the app, and when I did the video effects worked, but the text effects don’t work now, what should I do? Besides that I love the app!!"
4,ben dover 420 420 69 69,I’ve used this app a lot and it worked amazingly well but it has been updating recently and I think with each update it starts to glitch more while you’re editing. I’m sure it can and will be fixed but other than that it has worked great. Good for beginners.
5,theamazinggreenkids,"This app is a great app! It’s also the best free editing app I used if not the best editing app period, but the only problem is chroma key, when you try to take a color off it takes a bit of another color off. Hope you can fix it!"
5,thefightingqueen10,"Literally everything on here is free, I like how you can remove the watermark at the end without having to pay. Just one small suggestion, is there anyway you are able to make the green screen quality better? It’s very pixely."
2,MegoCD2,I was working on a project and mid project the style and 3D options were gone from one day to the next. Going on 2 weeks now. I was specifically using the 3D Zoom options in the Style feature and I know you all brought back the Style feature but the zoom options are still missing. Could you please bring the Zoom feature back soon?
5,alec <333,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this app and I’m really great at editing with it And I mostly love making velocity edits lol but what happend to the style option? The style option has the 3D options and the velocity option I just wonder if capcut took it off or if they just didn’t want people to use it anymore? Idk but I love this app ty!
5,awesomewolf12🐺,"First off I love CapCut- I use it every day (almost) and it’s so easy to use. The graphs are really nice, however I think it could use some better combo transitions. Ones like different shakes and ect, stuff that can be used in fancy edits and stuff. Although, I do super love the apps and affects, it’s really nice. 👍"
3,livynicole123x,"So I been using capcut for a year now, I've been doing some edits, you know? And usually my all of my edits get deleted from capcut by itself without me deleting it. Idk if its my storage or a glitch, but if it is a glitch please fix it. Thank you. 🤍 UPDATE!! So my friend was trying to do a edit, and she couldn't find style to do velocity, i checked too and i didnt see style. Did you delete it?"
5,jenbambam,"When I first started editing I was clueless, I thought this app was gonna take forever to learn. I managed to learn how to manage this app in just 2 days, this app is very good for beginners but it’s ability’s is like Expert level. I highly recommend this app for beginners and everyone."
4,Qwertqwertyuiopops,"I've really enjoyed using this app, but for some reason, the resolution never changes no matter what I set for the frame rate or resolution.  It's the same for all of my videos regardless off the quality of the source material, and it detracts a lot from what would otherwise be 5 stars in my book."
5,hello bsf,Well isn’t an awesome app to be editing on and whatever but I do really hate when eight update came out and when you try to update it it won’t let you and you don’t get that by the way that happens to me all the time please fix the CapCut😫😫😫😫
5,KBzach,This app made me a lot of followers on tik tok when I was a beginner I was like editing these is gonna take me a week but now it’s takin me like 20min I love it I can do a lot of edits thank you CapCut needs to improve the pitch things only and it will be the best editing app ever made in history who agrees with me?
3,BrianTheKranky,"I’ve been using the iPhone version for a while and quite satisfied with the outcome. The iPad version is missing the shortcut and camera buttons from the Home Screen. Other than that seems to work like the iPhone version. *** Oddly, the buttons appeared after I had force quit the app and restarted the next day ***"
5,LovelyxIzzy,"CapCut is awesome and a great app for beginners! I was on there today and was editing, and i came across the speed. I was confused at first but then realized it helped a lot to speed things up! :D  Here are my concerns: so like i said i went on it today, and went off to eat, but when i came back onto it all of my edits were gone? I’m confused, i still don’t have them back. I reset my ipad, turned it off, deleted and added back CapCut but nothing worked. Is there a reason? i’m very sad, if you see this please tell me! Besides that, CapCut is great, i highly recommend it!!! :)"
4,lissie flores,"So i’ve been trying to make an edit on the capcut app but every time i try adding animation,effects,etc.. the app tells me i have no wifi? i’ve been trying to switch my wifi turn my phone off and on again and it still won’t work? is there any way i can fix this bug?"
3,dcoguvrfuhneqrh,"Ok so this editing app is amazing. All my friends have been able to create masterpieces. But mine doesn’t work. None of the features will load and when I have full bars and everything else on my phone/iPad works, CapCut does not. I have only been able to access the features twice and I’m very frustrated that I cannot use the app for much."
5,rthxhhd,This app is amazing and I use it for making videos when I’m lazy and don’t want to transfer vids to my computer to edit. 5/5 amazing app and it’s well made and has all the features a computer video editor would have. Amazing app highly recommend!
4,Jordan Saffari,I love CapCut i use it for everything but I would love to have a coloring option to bring in our own kind of filters also if you could have to were we are able to put text animation like having the letters wiggle plus having them wave in then that would make this app five stars
4,Gwonam 76,Ok so this app is really good but as you know it’s not perfect which am guessing you read the title          right?  Ok so um it’s a bit better then kineMaster the audio doesn’t fade out an in for no reason over an over again but SOME TIMES it glitches an you can’t here the audio when you cut clips but other then that it’s pretty good
4,butty chiks,I love this app a lot I’ve Ben using this since 2020 this app is very simple and a very good app but it’s a little annoying when they say clean your Storage  i barley have apps so that is my issue with this app also when i put the bling it kinda glitches that is very weird but i love the update it was very creative and cool that’s all i have to say
4,TaIented KoaIa,This was such a game changer for my daily life I can edit in my bed without my computer and U had a big problem me and my sister shared a room so we have one computer and she studies there so now I can sit in bed relax in bed and edit my friend told me about this app and honestly its the best app but tbh I did not figure out how to add transitions hope it’s useful
1,tiana♥️,Every time I try to edit a video it says ‘ur storage is full’ my storage isn’t full at all I checked many of times and went to my settings and still my storage isn’t full...so I deleted the app and re downloaded it it still wasn’t working but not even that it said it wouldn’t download because I have to many apps..I countered my apps and I only have 13 that doesn’t seem a lot to me...so I don’t know if it just my phone or that app but I’m gonna have to rate this app 1-5 sorry🤷‍♀️
5,❌cheyanne❌,I love the app so much its so easy to use and i can actually figure things out easily -w- i have always had a hard time editing on other app and this is the most successful one i have has lemme say thing (because of this app all of my friends are simps for my edits-) :>
5,Almoudihini,I never write reviews but this app is so freaking amazing!!! Where has it been all my life! It literally has infinite ideas that are possible thanks to all the features of the app and so many things to do that bring out creativity!! 💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️💕💕
4,SkyDawnRose,"I like the app. It’s a good app for editing but i wish there were more animations and transitions. I would like for there to be motion animations, not shakes, but a little bit of movement so your picture isn’t always completely still. I would also like distortion transitions and or distortion flip transition. I hope you really look into this!"
5,kam3koo,"CapCut, is a really great app. I don’t really write Reviews but Anyways that’s besides the point. It’s a really great app and all but I think they should let you make your own Graphs when using the KeyFrames because then it’ll really go Together and when you use the KeyFrame it wouldn’t look stiff."
5,kenzy the banana,I love this App SOOOOO MUCH I've been using it for the past year now I have tictok and I use capcut to edit all my videos I recommend but every now and then when I try to  add photos to a new project it says “failed try again” or somthing like that so please fix that
5,Melz.tears,"Maybe when you go to anime a video or picture, add a little area where you can search the name of the animation you want to use for the edit. If this isn’t already in there, if it is, then sorry!"
2,bejendind,"I spent hours working on an edit and I went to download it but my storage was full so I deleted the photos and videos I used on the edit off my camera roll since every other time I did that, it worked. So I deleted the clips and after downloading it was just a black screen and all my work was deleted. Since I already deleted the videos I couldn’t get them back. I feel so stupid and disappointed"
4,Delgado LOVE,"I love this app but I’m sad the velocity got taken away , velocity is basically my whole account on Tiktok and I haven’t been able to post velocities I’m very sad and mad and I don’t know how to do velocity on any other apps and this is my main app that I use so can we please get the velocity back I see that other people are sad too."
5,hxrry_potter,"I literally love this app, I use this for all my edits, but may ask if you can add more unique transitions? I like the transitions that videostar has, but it’s to confusing for me. I was hoping that since I could understand capcut, would you please add more unique transitions, or combo animations?"
5,burrito_13man,"This app is really amazing if you need something to edit your videos, it has a lot of really amazing effects and filters, and it’s really easy to make good edits I suggest downloading this app if you need to edit a video but can’t find any good video editing apps that are easy!"
5,Josh_Random,"This app is one of if not the best video editing app out there. For months I’ve been looking for a free editing app with no watermark or subscriptions, then I found Cap Cut. This app has everything I could ever ask for in an editing app. I would recommend this app to all my friends."
4,randomguy1127,"So, I have had this app for a very long time and I love it! But, there’s 2 things that annoy me. 1. Whenever I play the video and it has very short clips those clips don’t show and it only shows the previous clip. And 2. Whenever I try shortening a clip, the + for adding new videos and/or pictures is in the way. This does 2 things. It makes me either swipe forward which wastes time, or it will make me choose a video/picture to add. So, the 2 things I want is: 1. A smoother play for shorter clips And 2. Move the + to the other side. This is the only problems I have and I hope you can fix it!"
5,Cat 👁👄👁,"I like this app it’s fun and easy to use 🌝 But I also suggest for them to put a shake/wobble effect Like when you use the electric box thing there should be a shake Effect to come with it! ⚡️ I think it would be useful, this is just a suggestion I think y’all should add. 🙂"
4,kiliklolol,"awesome app! here’s a few suggestions ^^. whenever you add effects or overlays we should be able to lower the opacity of them, and the green screen effect is glitchy. i’m not sure if that’s my video but it’s always glitchy for me and it’s irritating.. next id we could animate things on here, meaning that we could make the pictures move without presets, i get that this is a preset editing app but there needs to be a little bit more creativity. well that’s all i have for now, please look over this and consider adding some of my suggestions in, thank you and have a good day."
5,isantacakey,"I love this app it’s easy to use  I love that you can add your own music, Effects,Fonts,Filters,Backgrounds, and more THERES so much fun things to do with CapCut Im definitely recommending this app I make yt videos with this app and it’s amazing and it’s my only editing app I have lol definitely 5 Stars !!!!"
5,plz fix your self umong,I absolutely love this app it’s so easy to use and gives you so many tools. The only complaint I have is that I wish you can organize your edits I am very ocd and I hate how my edits are a huge mess I just ask that there was folders or something of that idea.
5,🥴😉🥴😉🥴😉🥴😉😉,If you go on my TikTok page (which is called dxlqx) I made an awesome edit and it took me a lot of time please go support that but anyways I think there should be a smooth slow mo because it’s glitchy so I rather fix that so it’s smoother because I really want to make edits without going on VSCO 😁❤️‍🔥
5,itsDerps!XD,"Of all the editing apps I have tried, none are this good that are FREE. This app contains everything you can possibly do without paying for anything exclusive. This app might be my new best friend when it comes to editing. This is definitely a 5 star rating from me."
5,inot_zoe,"This editor is highly recommended for me and I’ve been seeing amazing edits by other people, you should try too!  When I first starting watching edits, they were just, AMAZING! So I wanted to try too!  I first got on the app and OH BOY was it amazing! It made me think that this is amazing when I started editing! I first started on the iPhone and I’m telling you how amazing it is on iPad!   You should add a photo editor and people can use that on the app! And add more effects and transitions and maybe let people change the color of the app. Amazing app and its just the best app"
5,klausk99,"This is the first time I review an app! I’m amazed at how easy, helpful, and professional this app is. I am so impressed that I literally took the time to open the app story just to write this review. I highly recommend! Keep up the great work!"
3,cheetahmae1234,I have had CapCut for. Long time big fan. But one day I was a king a edit and whenever I pressed a effect it would say “not connect to wifi” when I was. I tried re downloading it but it never works what I’m saying it never lets me use effects and I’m really made because I’m a big fan of CapCut but I can use it. Please fix this because I want to edit or I will delete the app.   :(
5,Offcial_Midoriya-Deku,So I had edited a lot of my Gacha TikTok/Videos in this app and I actually recommend people to use this but whenever it sometimes freezes/crashes and stuff just we restart it easy peaszy lemon squeezy so I like to use this app definitely highly recommended
5,!?!!?!!!!!!!!!!,I love cap cit beacuse it says follow subscribe and like and you can put amojie i like it sow much and its sow fun i love it it sow amazing and there sow cute and im showing this to my friend it sow coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo i put 5 star for showing this comment its amazing cooooooool and my cousin say its boring she give you 1 star thats it any way i loveeeeeeeeeee ittttttt
4,Eris Skull,"I would’ve given this app a solid 5/5 response if it didn’t mess up a clip in your video if it got longer than 2 mins, when I'm trying to edit a video some portion of it is off time and it ends up ruining the rest of the clip. I don't know if its just me, but its a major throw off for me"
4,jfbdxbxhzgsnd,This game is a good app to do like tic tok edits and stuff but if your like new to edits and stuff I don’t think this will be the best app for you it is sometimes hard to understand how to use but when your practice more editing you will get the hang of it there is more edit for like people that don’t really good at editing for over all it is a nice app🕺🏽✨
5,uJzrdvn,"I love this app and use it for all my edits, but I feel that it is lacking one simple thing: folders. The home screen of the app is very cluttered (especially if you have many edits made) and a simple addition would 100% go a long way in the mobile editing community!!!"
5,StevenBose,"I’ve used a couple apps for mobile editing and It’s a hard thing to get right. But this app right here does it all, and makes it easy on you. Best editing app that I have used on mobile so far."
4,YourYellowDoggie,"Hello! I love using this edit app because of all the cool effects without having to buy a premium, no watermark, it’s overall perfect but at some points it is extremely slow/glitchy that I can’t even cut a part of a video or select anything. If you could fix that it would make my day! I love this app a lot"
5,orangekidblue,"Okay so, you can adjust certain filters and there should be a button where you can save the filter you made so you don’t have to remake the filter and there should be some options of overlays for lazy editors like me"
5,𝕁𝕚𝕝𝕝𝕚𝕒𝕟_𝕫𝕒𝕫𝕠,"I’ve been on cap cut for almost a year now,and my father recently just put on age restrictions and I would love if u put this as 9+ becuase I can’t find any other editing app better than this app!And one more thing,please add more fonts on there I would love if you did!  Sincerely,Jillian 💕"
5,sebdakiller,CapCut is an excellent editing app it has many features and many layers you can also upload your videos to other social media networks it also has many more features with the vip pass but besides that this app is a 5 out of ten. 😁
5,Skiingmike77,"i love this app. it lets me make edits for my friends and videos. the one thing i don't like are the lags for when it load but that's natural. anyways i love the app and i would recommend it to my friends and family if they need an editing app. great, amazing app and , once again, love it!"
5,lil sick bouy,Overall I really like the app I just wish it had some more features like different types of ways you can type out your words my last thing is I wish it had more filters but overall I love the app and I will keep using it🙂
5,Alpha_Gaming21,"Ok I am having no complaints with the app, no problems. Everything works out absolutely fine and the quality is how I want it to be. This ended up more then what I expected it to be. All I ask for is a bit more animation thingies. Overall it’s a great app and I totally recommend it!"
3,😇lily😇,I like this game but it would be better if you ALLOWED TO SEARCH MUSIC you give me this music and there’s no music that’s perfect for my projects I make maybe add some music that’s on Apple Music and for people to search music for music on Apple Music I mean music like my songs know what you did in the dark (light it up) or maybe CITY OF ANGELS (some lyrics: sold my sound to the devil for designer he said go to h***)
4,kpop413,"I love this app it’s better than any editing app I have tried but when I go to choose the photos for a project it doesn’t show the photos I just added I tried restarting the app, saving the photos again I even tried reinstalling the app but nothing worked I’m not sure if this is a glitch or if it’s just me."
3,anahsahnwhje,"I think it’s a great app, however it keeps saying “insufficient phone storage.” Even though I have got rid of over 100 photos.  I have deleted the app over and over again but it still won’t work. I have fixed my connection and yet still won’t work, it’s really annoying because this was my favorite editing app."
5,megano323,It’s really great because you can remove that thing at the end I don’t really know it’s called But you can remove it and there’s some filters you can use and I prefer to use them because they’re really cool and awesome
4,Memesakii,I really really love this app! I just wish that the overlay amount wasn’t so limited. Also I wanted to edit something today and all of a sudden the app stopped working. I redown loaded it and it’s still not working :(. Every time the app gets new things added it crashes and effects don’t load. It’s very irritating.
4,Iheartshadow,"This app is literally so awesome and it’s easy to use and edit with but, The style option keeps disappearing I update the app but it’s just not there anymore..I hope it didn’t get removed because the velocity is very useful . If there’s a way to get the option back please let me know. Thank you!"
5,jejfjddjddjjd,"I really love this app but it would be better if we can edit the combos speed like we can for the different speed things, and plz add more traditions and effects, and also able to determine the speed of the effects as well"
3,🦋 Dreamy 🦋,When I first got this app I was so excited and happy because most of the features cost money on other apps but on this one it was free! Keep in mind I got this last week. So I went to edit my video for my yt channel it said I had no internet and I couldn’t see the icons it was just grey. I restarted my iPad and it did the same. I checked my internet and it was all fine. Please help me I need this app
5,AJTexasTron,"So I think the app is great in all sorts of ways but, when I play the video its very glitchy. Like sometimes it stays in a part for while, while the the music is way ahead of it! :( Thank you for creating this amazing app but can you please fix a few things?Thank you."
5,ik tok is great,This app is a great app for editing!! Everything is free and it is so helpful!! I can make a godly edit in 7 minutes with this app!! There are some glitches but that’s ok!! This is my #1 favorite editing app!! The animation is so cool. CapCut is almost like video star but much easier!! I recommend this app for everyone!!
2,Soulpup24,"Hours and hours, months and months of work down the drain. I love capcut so much and it's such a disappointment to fail on me like this. The app was being a big buggy so i decided to uninstall and reinstall and all my months of memories and edits are gone. A login system that will guarantee this won't happen would be great. I plan to email capcut again about getting my stuff back. It's such a shame."
5,DovesRPretty,Capcut is a really great app and everything is free you can remove the watermark it’s so nice I love it but there’s one thing…/on tiktok capcut posted a video and on that video it had match cut but on my device it doesn’t i don’t know why but I would really appreciate it if capcut fix’s it. 👍🏻
4,bearbear200,"So I deleted the app thinking “I’d just re-download it again like normal” well that didn’t work it’s saying something about having to use a card/money to re-download it, I hope that’s just a glitch and I hope you’ll be able to fix it! But it’s a good editing app besides this"
4,Qudcia♡´･ᴗ･`♡,I love CapCut it’s a great app for making edits and etc but I just wish that the videos exported and it don’t mess up the quality but besides that I think it’s pretty good but cap cut please change that because it really does  annoy people when have to do extra stuff just to make it have good quality
3,wowwwwwwwwwww good but 1 plom,It’s a great app but I had to switch to KineMaster because every time you make too much videos it says storage for please clean up and I keep cleaning up and it never goes back again so I had to delete it and exchange from CapCut to KineMaster so it’s not that bad but I rather using KineMaster because there’s green screens and other future that are better
5,Med Interp,CapCut is amazing when I want to do a Edit of me and my friends  I try and it looks amazing I was a beginner but then CapCut help me so much I love the effects  you should  download it and it is free  and I just use it all the time and it is lit  that means cool I love it it has TikTok sounds and so many more great sounds I love it
4,tgg tgg TGg,I swear every time I restart my phone it’s there even though I deleted it and it’s weird. I keep making the joke that “ cap cut is haunting my phone” but that might be true. Other than that it’s a good app. The cool voice effects and the other features are endless. One of the best editing apps I’ve tried out
4,softiibear...🤍,Ok so this is so awesome I love how you added the velocity on the style which is amazing also I would recommend adding Better translations and better animations because the one you guys have now on CapCut is pretty bad no offense. But anyways this is a amazing editing app so I do recommend downloading💕
4,T0RT4,"Everything is cool and very easy to use. However, I couldn’t sign in to TikTok for the sounds. When I finally could, it said I didn’t have any sounds saved. Now it says I need to have internet connection. I really want to be able to use the sounds I have saved on TikTok. Everything else is perfect."
4,Giovani274,Capcut should have more voice effects because i’m trying to make a edit and i had to go to “sounds>>extract sound>>to no voice effects so Capcut could you make a old radio voice effect and make the sounds have the option to have voice effects
5,gifldkgi,"It’s all free! Stickers, text, editing, etc! It’s perfect! I would super suggest this. For beginner editors and for pro editors! This app is just like all the others. Except for one things... no in-app purchases or up-front purchases. No surprise fees, either. Thanks for reading my review!  ReviewsGirl2012"
5,ILoveWilson,"Before I downloaded this, I expected there to be lots of in app purchases or ads. When I installed it, I was surprised to learn that absolutely everything is free. This app is not like the other apps, and like it said, it’s too good to be true. What’s the catch?"
5,mila jo murphy .com,"When I first downloaded capcut, I wasn’t that good but I kept getting better and I really think this app is amazing! U can add effects filters, and more! I really hope everyone gets to experience this app."
4,ErrxrBxnnyYT,"I really like making videos on here, its a really amazing app and i can understand it really well! i do have one suggestion, I wish you could be able to search a song you want for the video, if that was added i would give it a 5 star because this is just an amazing app"
3,Bwilki,Ok so it’s a good app but it is using my storage and I have to delete things to make simple edits and one time I downloaded nothing and it said it even tho a couple secs ago it was fine also I’m trying to re download and it just keeps loading so it’s not on my screen so I can’t take it down and it’s annoying hope u can fix this 😚
4,Akiblo,"The app is great and all, but something’s kind of wrong with the app for me. I’ve checked my version to see if it were right and it says it’s up to version 3.3.0. When I try to open one of my projects the app tells me it needs an update. When I try to update the app, it fails. Any recommendations on how to fix this?"
5,bdhsjdbfbfjf,"If I was being very honest, CapCut is the best video edit app I’ve used so far! It’s fun to use, easy, and have tons of transitions and cool effects to make your video look awesome. If you are new I do prefer you to try this app out because it’s Actaully really easy, fun, and in general cool!🔥🔥🔥"
2,works on not?,"I’m with the wifi and I have wifi it’s connected and no trouble on other apps but I came across this one and this one just has trouble. Wifi like seriously, I tried to fix it but I didn’t use effects for a month in 2-3, I did what I could but it didn’t work I’m sorry I’m giving this app a 2 star rating it seems other people are great with it but I don’t know what is with mine I’m very sorry it’s terrible."
5,Affafafa,"Hello To the person who is reading this, when I first downloaded cap cut I thought it was hard to use, but then when I tried editing it was really easy to use and had a lot of options, thanks to this app, I started a yt career! So I recommend this app!! Thanks for everything!"
5,AZYUU.NET,"okay so. A few months ago I was trying to find a app that’s easy to edit on, and I found capcut! So I started messing around with the effects and having fun, doing all that stuff. This was the app that made my name be seen. And plus it is extreme easy to edit on. I love this app so much"
3,xhjfcjcjfjcjcj,I love capcut and everything about it it’s a really good editing app for mobile and really easy to use although i wish there were a system to save your edits/videos in the app itself because my capcut was automatically deleted by apple to save storage and when i downloaded it again all of my videos were gone
5,MarelynAlberto,I love the app!! I really do but I just updated it and now all the text in my passed videos have a whitish background behind it and it very annoying I was wondering what that’s about because I really enjoyed how it was working before I updated it.
5,🇲🇽AG,I love this app but there’s one problem some effects don’t work it will say No internet connection but my WiFi works and Sometimes I’ll put my Data on and some still won’t work only a few will work it makes me kinda mad
4,gzjgvjffgjhxeh,I like the app it has everything i need no watermark stickers voice customizer filters text everything good but not 5 stars because recently after I updated it it stop letting me use all those things now I’m gonna delete it and re download to see if that’s the case but yeah other than that it’s very good
5,goldenlotus12,Can do most of what any subscription app can and it’s free. This is tremendous gift as it is pretty gross how many cloned apps are out there all vying for your dollars. I would gladly pay a few for this one just because what they have done is a good thing and the app is also good.
5,random childdd,I love it I love this app. I love that there is like no ads I love that there is no water mark I love all of the animations i love it I love this app. It’s easy to use and just fun. Thank you for creating this app. I love it! One thing is maybe that you can create folders to put my projects but you dont have to.
5,MaidKit,The app is 10/10 amazing app but please allow us to add our fonts I want a certain font the app does not have and I want to be able to add that same goes for everything as well I want to be able to add my own custom things
5,donald for jail,"It’s working perfectly but, when I went on the app today, as soon as it opened it froze.I don’t know if it’s a phone problem or an app problem so I’m still giving you a 5 star review but that’s my only complaint"
4,StrANgeR 8472846382738462,Very good high quality editing app I myself have done many edits and impressed my friends. One single problem there is no dark mode for others it may not be an issue but for me it’s so annoying finishing a project in the dark and then getting blinded by the menu screen. Otherwise very good app
5,Ay4HNK,"Im trying to export a video but when i click on the top right corner to export it, a pop up says to give the app access to my device. It takes me to the settings, but i already have everything toggled on?! Help idk what to do but i wanna export that video!!!"
5,datclassic12yearold,"So I am a classic 12 year old making edits about my friends and pop stars I have been trying to find an app for that, this app is a wonderful joyride and it is all free, I literally love this app and I think that everyone who loves editing should definitely download this! Thanks so much CapCut❤️"
5,ElizabethJamess129,"So I’m a youtuber and capcut has ever been my first app. It’s amazing for beginners, and VERY simple! I recommend u downloading it. Not only perfect but the edits come out SOOOOO good! And you only need to pay for 1 thing! (Everything else is free) but one thing is when I add text and and go to bubble it doesn’t fit. GREAT APP AND DOWNLOAD IT!"
4,Madds…,"i love the app but when i am trying to click on small parts of the video, it is always a struggle with the transition still there. if for a new update you could take out the transition button when you cant add a transition anymore, it would make the app perfect, but over all. Nice Job!"
4,Goldensunsetwolf,"CapCut is a great editing app. I’ve used it for a while on my roblox edits, TikTok’s, things like that. But whenever I see people saying “oh my gosh, the new auto velocity feature is so cool,” I’m disappointed, because I can’t update CapCut, nor do I have the feature. CapCut just won’t give me the option to update it. I just want to know how."
4,Natalee19!!,I love it so much but if they don’t fix this little problem that’s killing me I would delete it to people who have it or not get it to people that do have my problem is if I don’t have too much phone storage then I can’t make a new CapCut video other than that it’s a great
5,KATTIEE😻,I love this app so much I’ve been using it for around 3 years now you might see some editors that professionals I’m still getting there I love the new updates my only suggestion as in “complaint” is if you could add more sound effects!
5,SwanRoseYT,This is really easy to use and can make really complex edits really easily! It’s free too. I’ve been using this for almost a year now and it’s one of my favorite apps. So if your are a editor or are a beginner editor I would 100% recommend this app.
4,Ellie Plays forever,"This app is very good for people who are beginners. There’s transitions, adjusting, cropping and more like that. Very good, but, the graph option doesn’t seem to work. I put my overlay and key frames but it spins instead of following the way I want it to go. So please, if you could, can you fix the graph option"
4,skudjdheiwusi,"The app is easy to use and editing is fun, though there is a problem. I can’t use favorited TikTok audios anymore because it’s says “No internet connection. Connect to the internet and try again” but my connection is perfectly fine, please fix this bug CapCut."
5,Brook haven mine!,"Alright so it might glitch I think it’s just because of my electronic but it’s really good it helps me edit Gacha videos and silly videos and all sorts of things so if your reading this and not sure what to do, you should download this! Plus it’s free!!!!  Stay safe everyone!😷"
4,thelilbeasty,"hi capcut! can you add more features that are NOT premade, can you try and add actual motion blur, better and smoother graphs, custom 3d elements / objects, a stretch tool, 3d overlay option, and better shakes? you might think this is too much to ask for but im pretty sure a basic editing app has atleast a FEW of these"
5,neckkutta,This app is amazing even tho it says that storage is full it’s no big deal just offload some apps and come back in I’m a beginner youtuber and this app helped me so much u guys got to try out this amazing app trust me you will love it! It is the best game edit video in the world! I love it❤️❤️❤️❤️ keep up the great work!
3,bloom noel,So I just downloaded the app and a couple of days ago and I use it for a Gacha life video’s or any other things I want to use it for. It’s such a good app I will and always use it I love the the things we can use in it for example like a filter for a picture or the stickers (I love the stickers btw) it’s so underrated and I would love to give this app a 20/10 in my opinion :)
4,ElaineGamerPlays,"I’ve been using CapCut since day one, but when on the second day I pressed add, and it said my storage was full. So i deleted 193 photos out 200, and it still said my storage was full! So i deleted apps, and still, said my storage was full. Please fix this, or I might have to search for another app."
4,ummmmmmmmm............,"This app is great. It has allowed me to make great edits but sometimes I have trouble importing a video. It will say “could not import check you internet connection.” The weird thing is, I am always connected to the WiFi at my house and have no problems with any other apps? Can anyone explain?"
5,hadi tahi,"CapCut is a good app for editing and it’s very easy to understand, but:  1.) When your finished editing and want to see your final edit it’s very glitchy and it stops playing.  2.) I think CapCut should add Graphs so it makes the key-frame smooth than it is right now.  3.) You could make the tutorial more specific because when I first started editing with using CapCut I did not know what to do, like where to find the animations, key-frames and more.  Overall it is a very good app for editing but needs a little bit fixing..?"
4,reloana,"So I had CapCut for a long time now to edit videos… but then it started saying I had no storage every time I wanted to edit even though I had storage…and I deleted it a lot and therefore it would work and then not work, I would recommend fixing the storage limit for that"
5,toodle mcdoodle,id like to start by saying ive never left a review for any app before…but CapCut really isnt just any app…as a video editor and broke college student ive tried every free editing app possibly created and CapCut tops them all. I hope yall dont change a THING because it s perfect 👍🏽
4,6yearoldgamer,"I use this a lot for editing, but one thing that’s really annoying is that I can’t access effects and transitions. It tells me I have no internet, but I have full bars. (No, it’s not blocked in my country.) Do you know why this is happening?  Refreshing CapCut has not worked."
5,uhhhhhghfdjmxmxms,"This app is so nice and cool. So much free effects and in fact, this app has no watermark and all effects and features are free. I really like all the effects, and features you can do. for example you can access a anime filter for your photos,   Definitely recommend this app!"
4,dnnddnbsksdldjxbdldb,"The no watermark and all free effects makes this my #1 go to editing app! The animations are nice and look professional! The only thing I have to say it I wish you could change the speed of the animations and the speed and place of the effects/animations, then it would be literal PERFECT editing app!"
5,karoajdjr,I love capcut very much it’s a great app to edit with but I wish it had a smoother slomo or velocity because it’s like a lag slomo and it kills me but like I said it’s a amazing app and also some new combos that will make edits look better but you should totally download this amazing app!
5,chasiteee,"Highly recommend this app, yhu can be creative while it being free very much recommend not for beginners tho sometimes when yhu first look at it, it looks very complicated but a good app. I swear other editing apps are not free yhu don’t have to watch ads pay for monthly. Good luck 👍🍀"
3,afiewaie,"I just did an edit but it stuck on the video and how I supposed to show my edits to my friends. If i didn’t edit it properly, my friend will laugh at me and mad at me because, I’m the one who edits my friends game. So, i give 3 star. If this happened again, I will give 1 star then i started to use alight motion and delete capcut ASAP. Please fix the bug. I really needs it."
5,aubriellia,So some people say it is hard but once you get used to it is easy know here is my review it took me like a month to learn how to use it but that is not the point the point is how good it is and for the like 5 months I have been using it it is a very good app 😃five stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
4,CallmeNutterMan,"This app is amazing I use it for ALL my projects it has great effects,great filters, and amazing other things (that I can’t thing of right now)  But there are still issues  1. It randomly kicks me out the app  2. When I save a project on my phone at a random part of the clip it just freezes and idk what’s wrong"
5,idkwhatishoulddo,"OMG i love this app! it might take some time to make some edits, but its amazing! i really recommend it and think its best for an editing app. I absolutely LOVE the effects, they really make my edits stand out. Once again, i really recommend this too whoever is reading this! thanks you for your time."
5,Savage949;lily,That is really great is free and all and everything but when my storage is full and I clean my storage And my storage been not for is always saying go clean your storage and then I delete and download it back and it says the same thing and I can’t edit..
5,Don't just a random,"I like the app I’d say it is good compared to most editing apps, although me and many others would love to see a feature where you could slow down the animation or whatever you’re gonna use."
5,jejdjsjdmjddm cjjd,"I like this because it doesnt really ask us for money like almost other apps but the audio isnt really what i wanted, i wanted like a file part where you import your audio in but i cant do that but just record the song i want. So please fix that."
4,molmaeeeee,"I’ve used this app for a while now, and I have loved it! There are so many transitions, effects, filters, and animations to chose from. The only thing I would suggest is to have more font choices or even allow it so you can download your own fonts on the app. Overall it’s a great app! Good job!"
4,pacified444,Okay so someone on tiktok was saying “where did the style button go i can’t find it” so i wanted to see so i downloaded this app and looked for it and i can’t find it. Please bring this option/button back because i don’t wanna do velocity the long way
5,HDUDHDUDSUD,I have always edited on iMovie and the experience has just never been good but every time I try and get a new editing app it either is a monthly fee or has a water mark so thank you for making this amazing free editing app it’s the best out there👍
4,aathena10,"Whenever I have a project, I would use CapCut, and when I was editing this, the audio was off and I checked to see if there was an update and restarted the app and realized nothing changed. I love this app and created pretty cool stuff. I would love it if you would look into this!  -(otherwise, I love this app)"
4,jenna cat,so i have had capcut for more than three or four months and i think it is fairly good! I just would recommend some stuff that video star has so then i can get basically a video star experience also you should bring back the electric light board! i need it for a edit so yeah!
4,HeheIPlayRoblox,"I love CapCut, I use it to edit my videos wich I end up OBSESSING with. I also wanna say, the app is great, and all but sometimes it won’t let me export my edits. Also, it can sometimes be hard to do certain skills and I find it hard to make smooth transitions in videos, overall, CapCut is great. Could use some working on, though🙂"
5,kkkkkkkylilllll,I love this app it helps me with my edits and make it look really good but why do we have to wait a long time for a smoother transition on speed when I chose a new setting and when my phone turn off it will start over
3,Its cha boy icy,Dear Capcut Company  While looking forward to the velocity update waiting says for it to be released upon  arrival of the date I come to find out even after updating the application the addition of auto velocity was not there and I am frankly disappointed in the amount of hype this update got just for it to disappoint us all in the end.   From: Disappointed CapCut user
4,Zamnet4,"Ok so first I wan5 to say th3 good things abou5 the app so first is I really like how easy i5 is to figure ou5 things and separate clips and music and #tuff, I also love how ther3ar3 a lot transitions an$ music an$ fonts! But sadly there ar3 som3 bad 5hings I dislike with are… There needs to b3 mor3 m7sic choices More fonts Filters And maybe  we should be able to add like our own music? And I really don’t like the fact that I only make like a five or 10 minut3 video an$ I can’t export it 5o m6 camera roll to post, but then a gain this is my opinion and everyone has there own opinions b75 I hope #omone sees this review and adds #ome of these thing# to CapCut!"
5,chchcherrybomb!,"I love this app and i use it to make short clips of things, though i have one suggestion to add to the effects. Maybe add a motion tracker so the video moves with the face. Again, it’s just a suggestion that I think would make it even more useful."
5,jvhiehnfgwhdhehnjd,"I absolutely love this app. It has everything I need in one place. And on top of all that it is 100% free with No ads. Yes, you heard me right, NO ADS! I was able to make an outstanding movie using this app. It uploaded very quickly. Overall 5 stars if I could 10 stars!"
4,i just need sime robux lol,"Okay first of all, the animation is really bad. There’s absolutely no graphs! I would recommend adding graphs (if it’s not too hard for you guys). And my second problem is THE STORAGE! I only like what 20 projects and the app wastes so much storage! Mine is literally 20 gb!😐 but overall the app is great and is amazing for beginners."
2,BIG BOOTY JUDY 😙✌️,It’s a good app but then it started glitching to where when I would split a clip the clip that I just split would be a black screen and I closed the app and reloaded it multiple times and it still did that so then I deleted the app and lost all my progress on everything and then I’m trying to redownload it now and it hasn’t even started downloading and it’s been sitting here loading for 30 minutes now
5,morning gloy ❗️,This is the best editing app I have ever had in so happy thank you for making this app I have been struggling with finding an app that did not have a glitch and did not make that glitch delete my work I love this app so much good work I highly recommend 😁
5,Vane420ssa,This is a really good app it helps me a lot with my videos but when I use the remove background button it removes all of the video/photo and it makes me really angry or disappointed so can somebody fix that and remove JUSt the background?
4,dfdic is u tv fvyjycod,Often I would find many glitches where it couldn’t import a photo where it wouldn’t let me edit anything and sometimes it will tell me I didn’t have any room when I had only two photos in my gallery it’s very annoying but overall a great editing app
5,khloe109082,"CapCut is saying that my storage is full, when i delete aton of my fav edits , games and pictures is says storage is full im very use to this app and not any other app this  is a very good app and i dont wanna stop using this app i cant make any edits 🙁 cause its saying storage full"
3,geekygirl2,"I love this app and it’s FREE, so why only 3 stars?  Because there is no landscape setting for the iPad Pro 12.9”.  It’s ridiculous to try and use a device that large in portrait mode for a video app.  Please add landscape support.  I use it on my iPhone and it’s great.  Super easy to put together multiple clips, add a title, etc.  But please, the ipad app needs this most basic setting."
3,jakkiyy,I’ve been with cap cut for 7 months now it’s a great editing app but I’m trying to use effects but the update is horrible! I cant seem to find we’re all the effects went I need them for my edit! I hate the effects update and please change it back!!!!! Or at least change it to where you have options oh my god!!!
4,ojgvgry,"Overall it’s an amazing editing app that you should 100% get but what I do is I make edits not like vlogs. And since I do, I would like for you to add a time lapse on the black flash, like the time period, y’know if you want it slow or fast, you have the choice. 2. I would like you to add where you can use gifs on the app."
5,•PastelBlueWolfe•,"I love CapCut, i do a weird social media occupation so I love this. no watermark! WOOHOO! But I really wish that it had unlimited layers or at least a little more layers- it would make my expirence a bit easier! But besides that it’s a 10/10 app that I recommend to my friends"
5,Flamingo fan123,"A suggestion I had is for the effects. Some of them bounce around and stuff, but I wish there was an option to slow it down. So I ask if you can make an option to make it slow or faster please!  Thanks,  -Hayden"
5,crispyfishlegs,Yo how is this app free? It has so many awesome filters etc. and it lets you save videos WITHOUT a watermark!! I was beyond shocked to find this out! I originally got it just for fun after seeing the tiktok Sugar Crash trend but I think I might use this for serious video editing for my song covers! I love this so much!
4,Alicat_Plays,"Sometimes I get logged out of it, it makes me frustrated and nervous that I can’t make yt vids anymore, I would like you to fix that. If you could this would be Amazing and a 5 star review. I’ve deleted your app capcup and to maybe re-do-it! But it won’t load.      Thanks for making this great game!  -Alicat_Plays"
4,huhuhboi807,"This has to be the most underrated and best editing apps that are out their. This is the first time I’ve ever wrote a review for a app that’s how good it is. There’s only 3 features I hope will be coming to the app in the near future. A glow effect, a cut out effect, and a motion blur effect. If these effects where all added I would be giving a 5/5"
5,Egnory,"Okay first of all, creator I think your need a award of being the kindest and best person ever. second of all FINALLY AN APP THAT U DoNt HAVE TO PAY FOR TO EDIT!!!And the fact that it’s so easy to edit is amazing, other apps are so confusing for me (no offense) but CapCut is amazing, thank you so much!!!"
5,Rolly1a,You should add a glitch effect where you can place the glitch where ever you want on the screen. And a animation that is like it’s moving side to side like a sway but slow and then it zooms in a little bit and zooms out a tiny tiny bit :)
4,Redonkalousy,Did they downgrade this app and took out features and editing options? What happened?  Update: I changed 1 star to 4 stars now they put back Style. Big Head is missing still though but I’m happy Style is back for iOS devices. It didn’t go missing for Androids.
5,tashinamaria,Okay from the title there is a problem its the word “problem“ you see i have an ipad and i wanted my video to go faster so i went to make it faster and the button is black why? Why is it black?
4,👁👅👁 wow 🤩 love this app,I love capcut and it’s so easy and can make good edits! So now ur probably wondering why I gave it a 4 well because when I first got it I had Style as an option for my vids but now I can’t find it and I looked in every tab so I guess capcut took it away :( so now I’m updating it rn hoping that will give me style again
3,strawbrm112,"This app has been really helpful and I rlly love most parts about it but it keeps making a video not sinc up with the audio correctly. For example, a video of me talking will make it look so stupid because my voice is completely off with the movement of my mouth. It keeps doing this over and over and it's rlly getting on my nerves"
4,Marsh Floof,"Hello CapCut! I don’t usually write reviews, but this time it seemed like I should. If you’re considering getting CapCut, I really recommend it… especially if you’re editing your Gacha videos or tiktok/insta posts. I was using KineMaster for every video that I edited, then I tried out CapCut. CapCut has much features and I would rate it a 9/10. :)"
3,skyflypitchy,Overall CapCut is an amazing app but there are issues. The projects I’ve made over time will not let me edit them again and when I try to go into the project it says Couldn’t update try again later. This has been going on for awhile now and I hope they will update the app or fix it soon.
5,ue frend,"—Capcut is BY-FAR!!!!!!! the best edition app for anyone who’s beginning in editing, It’s is very easy to learn about and catch up on how to use it  —I LOVE THIS APP, even tho it has its downfalls  which is usually not having an effect u want, BUT this app makes it easy to make that effect your own.    —Also, capcut (imo) it’s prolly better used for picture editing and not video- BUT from my experience capcut makes a PRETTY good video editing and will blow ur mind  —ALSO p.s i’ve had capcut for about one year and the amount of improvement i’ve made is INSANE!  💯💯💯💯💯  -Thank You"
4,fhdgdhfcbndnd,"It’s a great editing app, but one thing I find pretty annoying is when the video gets over about 10 minutes it starts to get pretty laggy. And it takes up quite a lot of iCloud storage. But other than that I have no issues with the app over all!"
3,LOOOOOOOOOVE IT <3,Basically I was gonna use CapCut but when I putted my photo it didn’t pop up 🤨 it was just black I asked for help that didn’t work plus after a while after re getting the app the next day it says I’m “internet not connected” “check your internet” my internet is fine 🙄 and working fix your app for now I’m going back to KineMaster 😘👋🏽
4,363864,"I love this app so much especially all the free features it’s the best thing ever I was wondering if you all could make a motion tracking optimization so I could motion track overlays and videos and photos I think this would be really helpful, but other than that this app is amazing no ads and love the quality."
5,ILOVETHISAPPSOMETIMES,"This is is amazing with editing! But sometimes when I try to make a new edit, it tells me I have to much storage but my photos tell m Eli don't and it’s becoming to get on my nerves and I don’t like when it happens when I’m just trying to edit"
4,sharks rulu,"I love making edits and stuff but for some reason now nothing will load like a can pun in pics and add music but I can not do effects, filters, or my text effects. It’s saying that I’m not on WiFi but I’ve tried everything even on my hotspot pls try to look at this."
4,Elizabeth87659,This is a very great app but this is a lot of megabytes and then it turns into a gigabyte and I don’t have that much space I only have 32gb my dad got me a cheaper one and I would like more space but I don’t want to pay for anything so can you lower the megabytes or do something else in the app
4,❤️HII,"hello! As a capcut user this app is really easy. I do have some suggestions for the app, i think adding motion blur and keyframes and definitely some more traditional movments also i think it would be super cool if there where some temples. I also think after effects would be a great app for inspiration :) over all its amazing:D"
5,roblox meeeeeee,capcut requirs access to the album for editing and saving videos But every time i click on confirm it bring me to settings. I already have let it have full access to my photos so i don't know whats going on.
3,WhoCaresSboutPeoplesName,Ok so its awesome and all but true problem is that you have to have less storage to see and export this stinks I have deleted almost everything I have and still won’t work seriously how much room do you need to export OR EVEN EDIT THE CLIP people that’s reading this and wants to download this be aware of what your deleting cause I lost my dead cats pictures cause of the dumb app!!!
4,fhdjcjsv,Ok the only thing I have a problem with is that I literally have no photos or anything and I don’t have a lot of apps yet it still says I have no storage and I’m not allowed to make anything at all also it can be rlly glitchy sometimes and won’t let me see my photos
4,~ℂ𝕒𝕟𝕕𝕪~,I got into cap cut and it was perfectly fine the other day when I got in today it wouldn’t let me add photos and when I tried to go to settings it would only let me change the notifications and Siri thingy I have no idea what’s going on I deleted it and downloaded it again cap cut can u pls help me?
4,coolfine9449,They should change some parts of the app like when you trim the individual videos the effects and overlays automatically adjust to that part of the video instead of having to go back and adjust all of them manually.
4,Cheylyn Agneaux,"When I try and crop an extracted song or sound it makes me have to drag it so it won’t be separated. It just makes me take longer and it frustrates me. But it is a really good app, I used to use KineMaster but I really like this application. If you could fix the crop and move thing I hate that would be awesome! Thanks!"
3,Markiehdisba,"so basically capcut has been working fine for a long time now, today though the transitions are glitching? like their stopping in the middle and then restart. I don’t know how to explain it but basically when i try to put a transition it just stops and glitches and then goes on. it’s so weird and it has never happened before. please help !"
5,*~{ello~*},"Cap cut is amazing! It’s great for gacha, tik tok, editing, etc. The watermark is free too delete! (For you tik tokers or gachatubers.) But also EVERTHING IS FREE!! It’s amazing I love it! One thing is that the audio keeps going when you export. (Annoying sometimes) Overall this app gets five starts!! Thank you for reading!"
2,PinkFluffyUnicornYT,"I love this app, but I can’t do ANYTHING a fun with it! Every time I try to use filters, animations, or effects, it tells me to check my internet connection! It is ALWAYS on, and the app hasn’t changed anything about it. It’s very annoying, especially because for SOME people it works, but not everyone. If that were fixed, then ABSOLUTELY five stars. The internet connection is definitely worth three stars though."
5,You're not helping,This app and Roblox is the best combo ever!  This is great for new youtubers and their are so many great things about the app. And the fact that it is all free is just amazing. I used to spend money on all these other apps until I found capcut. It helped me grow my tiktok account too!
5,Amber Stefano,Honestly for a mobile editing app this is PHENOMENAL! So many effects and there are LAYERS !! Of course it would be great to see some more transitions in the future and other effects but I’m absolutely loving everything already! Great job to the creators and thank you for making it watermark free ! You guys rock!
4,👄💋💄 i hate my job,"So I’m making an edit with 9 removed back grounds and when I remove the background on a image other than the the first, it cuts out the back ground. But in the shape of what wasn’t cut out in the 1st image. There’s also some other bugs h other than that it’s really good and I love the app. (It’s allllll freee too❤️)"
5,Jo.elll,Honestly this app is PERFECT if youre looking for a good editing app for edits and easy to use this is the best app especially since it’s all FREE I think the only thing that I’d change is add some more effects like more aura options or some animated frames and stuff but other wise this app is amazing.
5,Jjuilerut,People have been saying a lot about this app that it’s not very good and all that crap because I’ve used this app for my transition and one edit a made using this app managed to gain me 20 followers in one day this app is amazing despite what anyone else says keep up the great work!!!
5,Brighton1605,"In my opinion it needs Green screen support, and a picture in the picture thing kinda what iMovie has (don’t get me wrong I prefer this editing app over anything) but that’s pretty much it I don’t have any more complains"
4,where is the delete button???,The app is good but it could be a little bit better like maybe adding a recently deleted thing..? I just deleted a edit and now I cant get it back:( That would be great if you added that thanks overall the app is good but it could have some adjustments!!
5,xxzwowxxzwow,there’s one thing it takes up to much storage there should be a clean up button for storage if it gets filled you can get rid of edits that take to much and have it recommend witch ones to delete or not
5,♡︎♡︎𝗷𝗶𝗻𝘅♡︎♡︎,Alot of people are requesting 3D effect or text animations! I think thats a very good idea! I also have an idea of being aloud to add in-animations and out-animations at the same time because some times i dont really like the combo animations.
5,a person named candice,It’s okay although I don’t like how the fade in and out have little flashes of blur. Overall the rest is good and i like that it has velocity so I don’t have to spend hours trying to make it when the slow motion isn’t smooth
2,marshstrs,"Recently whenever i try to manipulate graphs between keyframes, as soon as a select a graphing option (custom, ease out, etc) the latter keyframe point automatically crops itself to original size and centers the video/photo. really messes up transitions and has put a hold on me making things as often as i would like to. Seems its a really bad bug multiple people are experiencing. Nothing I do fixes it."
5,jejjekekekej,"Capcut is a really useful app! I really enjoy making edits here 100% worth it, Capcut is one of the top 10 best editing app, there’s only one problem…Nothing! I love this app so so much if you didn’t download this app you’ve made some bad life choices! This app is the best:)!"
5,ncd914,"Honestly , if you want to charge me a little for this app, you can. It's that good. It makes my editing process so easy. Even if I'm just doing small video edits for myself, this has been the smoothest editor I have used on my phone"
4,Pixellant47,"I love this app! It has so many choices of stickers, word fonts, and more! With the audio I love how you can sigh in to Tok Tok and have a lot more audios, but the sighting it part is not working for me, like the way with when it says to sign in with google, it won’t let me. I hope you can fix this shortly!"
4,Random_ Ideas _ Entertainment,"It’s a good app and I like it but I have one problem with it and it is the remove background option and when I use it , it removes the background yes but it also removes the picture or removes part of the picture so i am annoyed but other than that it is good"
4,シ𝕔𝕝𝕠𝕦𝕕𝕪𝕓𝕠𝕚シ,I love CapCut I use it for all my edits but I have one problem so I sometimes recorded theAudio and extracted but like there a silence in the first half so I edit audio when I try edit the video to make I shorter I wnat the first part to be shorter but I makes the last part  shorter   And I like CapCut cause it’s good for everyone ❤️
4,Happy happy cultists,"For the voice effects in would love to be able to select the time in which I want the voice effects to be activated. I don't want the whole video to be the chickmunk voice, I want it to be a part of the video not the whole thing please change that thanks :)"
4,fFzgFFYzzgGhZhx,"I was using the remove background tool one day and it was working perfectly. Today i went on to use it again and it was cropping the background super badly, cutting off lots of parts of me and including lots of the background. I hope this gets fixed cause this was a great tool."
5,Mikey silverss,"As a developer, and visual design editor for our company I’ve used several (actually30) apps and the full Adobe suite and I can say this app is the best your going to see when it comes to mobility. Let’s continue to support and help upgrade this thing. Just wow!"
3,Nora Snowy,Easy to use and learn how to use but if you video gets longer than like two minutes it starts lagging too much to continue. And I exported a video that was five minutes long and barely any effects took 30 minutes to export and when I watched it through all the clips had been put in a random order.
5,Nevaeh Steed,I have just started CapCut and it is just amazing I thought VivaCut app was gonna work out and apparently I was wrong. CapCut is so much better iv had so much fun with this app and I recommend  100 percent when you are editing I have made the best edits with this app and mostly everything is free!
3,jayden yoro,"I would spend hours editing a vlog video and every time I tried exporting it, it kept saying “something went wrong”. After trying again, it finally finished BUT it said “insufficient storage”. It doesn’t make sense because I have so much storage left and how it would tell me that at the last second. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD FIX IT!!!! This upsets me."
5,gracefulscarlettz,It’s amazing wonderful great but… it could use another background like behind the counter for a cafe or a cafe background I’ve always wanted to do a cafe vid but I can’t I’m public it’s to loud so if you could make a behind the counter cafe back ground and a cafe background it would be the best pls
4,von_c-apZ,every time i edit a video it says my storage is full and i deleted a lot of things but it still said it was full. it takes so long to upload my videos. it doesn’t even work but before it had no bugs but now it does🤦🏽😤
5,MIKAHmikah✨,"When I first heard about this app I was scrolling through TikTok.  I’m telling you, you find everything on that app.  But Capcut is good for editing videos and even pictures.  Way better than Videos star or VSCO.  I totally recommend this.  No bad reviews from me!"
5,𝗴𝗹𝙤𝙨𝙭..𝙘𝙝𝙖𝙧𝙨,Ok this app is good but the thing that stops me is that is saids is full and i deleted all my photos and my project’s but still said the same thing 😒and i reset my phone and it happened the same thing!
5,Zombieshadow360,"This editor has no water mark and it’s easy to use and free but there is one thing that it needs a thing to cut out for images, and videos frame by frame but other than that it’s a really good editor thank you CapCut"
5,Trekgaming,I can say this confidantes as I have used many. Not only is this totally free but it has no watermark. It also has Soooo many more features than some of the apps you’d have to pay to use. 12/10. would recommend.
1,August 6 2019,"I don’t know where to start. I was making a video. This had taken  me 2 days and I wasn’t even half way done. Fanpages are the ones that mostly use this app yet yall fail to make them happy. I’m a fanpage, and you deleted my video that I was making. It isn’t funny at the fact this took up most of my storage and time while I could be doing other things. Please give the video back. It has aesthetic videos of charli damelio, nailea devora , and ariana grande . Thank you."
5,jhsksbsk,Thank you for CapCut but there’s just something that’s a bit off you see other apps have nice shake effects and there’s not many good ones to pick there I some really good animation tho but they can’t compete with your animation but they can by using shake effects
5,lia lila lola leona,I use this app so much it’s so easy to figure out and sooo easy and just make good edits it’s just so easy to make good edits you can either put up some old memories and show it to some family or make new memories and show them to friends it’s the possibilities are endless
5,somethingrandom.4610,"I love CapCut. It amazing for basic editing and it has no watermark. I think they should add custom transitions. You could use keyframes for this but it doesn’t look very smooth. Also, I think they should add some type of custom motion blur for transitions. Otherwise, this app is amazing"
3,bzo4u,"I mean tbh, the app is great for editing and everything.. but for me when I’m editing it’s super laggy and i can barley watch it without it lagging . it’s hard t use the app when it’s always lagging when i try to edit and when trying to upload it won’t alow me to . I love the app but I would just like to see it improved ty and bye !!🧍🏾‍♀️"
4,oakalydoakaly ❣️💗🤪,Liek I said it's good but it was hard for me to understand it when I first got it and I'm still sorta confused but there should be a tutorial in the beginning so your not confused while trying to make a video and then get mad and delete it but that's my suggestion otherwise it's a really good app!
5,emerald XD,"Also please keep this free forever. I HATE video star. It takes so long and costs money. I love this. This is easy to use, has ton of edits and helps me so much for my insta edits and edits for my friends. I’ve been recommending this to all my relatives and friends. I hope you keep this free forever"
3,Export woes,I love this app but every time I export something it comes out super choppy. I’ve checked the frame rate on my phone and played around with the export settings and every time it comes out really choppy. One time I had to re-edit an entire project with another software cause it came really choppy.  No matter how much I mess with the export settings it always comes out choppy.
5,jackq217,It’s a really great app like very good! It’s just that whenever I want to overlay something it never works. Ex: I put. A picture and I decide to put words on there I tap the overlay button and nothing happens. I’d really appreciate if you could fix this bug.
5,al3xx03,Whenever I try using the bling effects it tell me I have no internet connection. Please look into fixing the issue I really enjoy using this app for edits but haven’t been able to do so with this glitch. Thank you!
3,Cathaline F.,"Hello, these days I’ve been having problems. I don’t know if it’s slow but when I was to add a transition, I can’t see it. I don’t know if it’s loading but I restarted my phone. Downloaded the app again, and it’s still like that. I’m annoyed by that. Now I can’t use this app anymore. I can’t even change the font. Please fix it, I’m going to find another editing app."
5,TimBsTechTalk,"Viamaker (now CapCut) is very nice! It comes with basic features like transitions, PiP, titles, stickers, overlays, audio tracks, effects and animations. The app is free and does not appear to include in-app purchases.   More recently, the app added chromakey and key frames.  I may be asking too much, but it would nice to rotate the canvas horizontally."
5,dab_06,This is by far the best free editing app I’ve found and I love it. The transitions and effect are awesome love them. But sometimes the video lags while I’m editing and idk why but it could just be my phone. Overall it’s nice and I’m for sure going to keep using it in the future.
3,Dresden Gierman,"This is a great editing app, accept when I import videos to edit, the audio from the original video is off. I can’t just re-add the audio, because then I can’t add things such as voice effects. I hope this issue gets resolved, but other than that, this is a great app! I would highly recommend!"
4,Axel the GSP,It’s got no adds or in app purchases that I know of and it doesn’t have any real errors  It’s good for transitioning in videos and has really good effects the only reason that I give it a 4 star is that it doesn’t really have a way of sharing videos but it’s a good app to have
4,Justareviewaccoumt,"It’s good for editing,smooth, and uploads in pretty good quality. Overall I’d say amazing app. Although I personally have some issues. For example, I cannot use the “auto velocity” style option. It just doesn’t appear for me. I was wondering if there’s a way to fix this. (And yes my app is up to date)"
3,hiseethis,I’ve been using this app for about a year. It’s been great until I’ve got my new iPhone 13!? When I update the app it takes away things I can’t use as many effects and crashes. Also I just I just updated the app and now it won’t load any animation or nothing. Please fix this I don’t want to have to move to another editing app!
4,Katieloveydovey,Hi don’t give me wrong capcut is a really good editing app! BUT i was editing and i went off the app for just a second and capcut deleted ALL my edits and it told me terms and conditions and how to use it:( i was working on an edit that took 3 hours and it deleted the whole thing including other edits i have made please fix this now andd FREE MOTION BLUR IS A MUST GOOD
5,Milk teau,"Hi, so I’ve been making a lot of edits that have overlays, and I need to make the overlays slower because when I want the overlay to move across the screen, it’s too fast. So please make the overlays available at ALL times. Thanks."
4,sunshine girl Bacon,"This is another part to the photo problem, the best way I can describe it: It goes all good then all of a sudden it freezes on one photo and glitches on that photo and then skips like 5 photos and then shows another but that’s the best I can describe the problem."
4,somthing63663,I love this app it has amazing effects etc. BUT I’ve been useing this app for a while now and some glitches have appeared on here like when I downloaded one of my edits when I took out a part it replaced it with a text message that would be removed but put back :/
5,kop679643,I love playing is I make so many video of is the 1 day I got it I did 5 video is it so easy and fun u can do Roblox videos and  videos of u it is so much better than any other editing app I ever had so if you look at a add to make video is this the 1-frog🐸😏🍄
5,zelda💃,"I really love the app but it would be nice if you could add a few more layers in your projects, i want to animate a character moving but i cant add enough layers to put all the parts in. Other than that i love everything about the app! ❤️"
5,GameReviews2018,"This editing software is way better then all the others, even those where you have to pay. 10/10 would recommend to anyone"
5,🌸✨indieem✨💞,"I’m an editor, and I highly recommend CapCut! I love the app and have had it for about 5 months. It’s easy, full of fun stuff, and free! I highly recommend for beginners The only con is that it takes up a lot of storage, but that’s it! This is my honest review of the editing app, CapCut."
4,Voxilit,"i love this app, its super simple and easy… but thats the thing, its good for new editors but once they get good they are gonna use alight motitor something. So some improvements you should make are better keyframes, graphs, and the ability to make our OWN transitions like alight motion, other than that i love it"
5,jdjfjsjjsjdjdjs'dkkdididdjjdd,I love it all it’s easy to use when you watch a tutorial it’s the best keep it up I love it I bet nearly all of the famous ticktokers out there are famous because of CapCut! Thx alot I’m really happy now since I learned how to use CapCut once again thx a lot!!!!!
3,lullaby456,I wish that there was a recovery option to recover my edits that I accidentally deleted or wanted to retrieve back but I’m disappointed at the fact that I spent days editing this one particular edit and accidentally deleting it and can never get back. My phone didn’t even back it up either. 🙄
5,i love roblox poop,So when I downloaded this it was cool but when i tried the “shortcut” IT WAS AMAZING i edited my video and it turned out amazing i also love how you can add music this is an amazing app if you want to edit! I highly recommend downloading this app it is amazing i give it a five star rating!!!
4,PogoN1823,"This is the best app I found for editing, and I love that it’s free! The only problem is that the app itself is quite laggy (most of my friends have the same problem) and crashes occasionally. That makes it hard to edit consistently, but other than that, really great!! 🧡"
5,Imperial Roblox Lover,I love this beginner app it’s my most favorite and without this I cannot do a channel but it keeps saying that I can’t upload a file so I can edit i thought it was a bug/glitch but I uninstalled it and it made it worse please help it!
4,iiMilqy_x,"I like the app and the effects and everything but although there is one thing i really want to recommend you, is that please add more overlays because i cant stack more overlays for my video its would be helpful id would do that i will also give it a five star if you would do it."
5,This Bot,When i tell you this app is AMAZING 🤩 i absolutely love the app and i think it would be even better if u keep the premade transitions and add a thing where you can make ur own transition also where you can make a custom mask for your edit thats all i want to say
5,hjfvyhvnfjdjfjusufhdhdjksosof,This app has helped me with better edits and I love it a lot I never get bored of it and I love it I’m like addicted to it I can stay on this app for days loll but thx for making this it had really really helped me with edits and everything so thx so much u need a lot of credit thxxxxxx❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
5,BLOCKHEADS FUR LIFE,"Has everything I need for editing and video edits! No water mark which is absolutely AMAZING, tons of choices for effects and even photo editing like 3-D zoom which is also very amazing. I love the animations aswell as the text options! Awesome for editing would 101% reccomend!"
4,izabellamarie21,Soo like I said one bug happened so once I deteted the app and rn when I tried to download it again. Oh and I’m on Apple iPhone it didn’t let me download it it’s taking forever if so if it’s already downloaded I’m sorry for being mad and rude. If not and it’s a bug or glitch please fix it.
5,XxSunflower_SeedsxX,"So I am a Gacha maker, so I thought for a long time, what kind of app should I use? THEN THIS SHOWED UP. MAN, NOT EVEN 2 MINUTES AND I ALREADY MADE LIKE WHAT, 12 VIDS!!! I AM SUPER AMAZED BY THIS APP! IT HAS ALL OF THE AUDIO YOU NEED, ALL THE ANIMATIONS YOU CAN THING OF! So I just wanted to tell the creator that they did an amazing job on this beautiful app. I hope everyone enjoys this app. BYEEEE! HAVE A GREAT DAY / AFTERNOON / NIGHT!!!"
5,alicechaaira,I love this app these graphics are amazing one thing that bothers me is whe I get confused lol so I love this app I’ve been learning new things and there awesome the effects and the titles I love how the colors and all the stuff I just love this app I keep saying that but ITS AMAZING UGH I cant I’m obsessed that’s all I need to say AHHH   -Sam
4,Mercy_EP,"don’t get me wrong, I love this app, it has so many great features not to mention no watermark! However a few days after I installed I realized when I crop/lengthen clips it suddenly freezes for a few seconds. I’m not sure why this is happening but it’s quite annoying"
5,spaice dust,I got the app yesterday and i am in-love with it.  It has no adds!!! The edits i can make with cap-cut is very cool!  This app is perfect.  I haven't really used it a-lot yet but if there is anything else i will write another when i have a opinion about what you should change.
4,fnrdigfsri,"So the app is AMAZING. And free. NO WATERMARK and its great for making videos but...for some reasons, there’s days that the buttons don’t work. I was to use a cool effect but every time i press it, it doesn’t do anything. It takes a few hours for it to work. But why don’t the buttons work?"
5,Bad beat,"This app is GREAT and recommended but here is the thing: it won’t let me add texts, change the filter or anything on the bar below. The only thing that did work was the adjustments. Can someone explain how to enable the things?"
4,Aries Ark,Ok this app is amazing it really improves the quality of my videos. It would’ve gotten 5 stars but some of the effects that I use have be taken you why is that? Overall if you are looking for a really awesome video editor I would choose this
5,Rhi315,The transitions they made are pretty good they should make more though and add motion blur/tracking blur and colorings. But other than that it’s pretty good! The video quality is top notch and the frames are amazing because you get to save it so high which is not in a lot of editing apps.
5,Toxicmychael,I’ve been trying to find an app where I can edit without having to pay money that I don’t have and I’ve been looking for years and this app is the best thing to happen to me and I’m so glad that I found out about it 😌😌
4,danipaige,"This is typically my go-to app for making edits. But a problem has occured quite a few times where one video clip will freeze for a couple seconds before going to the next clip. I've tried updating, restarting my phone, trimming things differently. Idk what else to do"
5,kaylinahtae,"Literally the best editing app I’ve ever come across. First off, all the tools I need to make a great edit are free!! That’s mine-blowing and there’s no catch. The edits I make look advanced and have a high-quality style to them. I’m obsessed and now I’m so excited to make more edits in the future."
5,unicorn b4,"ok so im only rating this five stars so people can see this and here’s my story (well ofc in general i love this app and will rate it 5 stars but i’m keeping this up until they fix the bug…). i came to the app store and updated my capcut because it said i needed to update. i came to make my daily velocity edit but when i clicked make it smoother and then click better quality, after it processed, there’s a weird green flash. thank you i hope you fix this bug capcut!!! 🤗💗"
4,luna moon.,"I love capcut. It’s great! But..I kinda have a problem. Whenever I’m trying to use sounds from TikTok, it always says: “no internet. Please try again when connected to the internet” even when I am connected! Please fix this. Thank you <3"
4,النجلسزيه,"The application is good, but the storage space message makes people do not enter it often, because this message comes for no reason and that is the problem that people often fall into, please we hope to fix this problem..♥️"
4,PatriciaIsSoCool,"This is a great video editor app that I love using and it can like do everything, but when I tried to use the TikTok sounds feature and login with my TikTok it didn’t work and kept saying I had no favorite sounds even though I did. But other than that it’s a great app!"
4,BUSTED_BILLETS 504,Hello! Thanks for reading my review and personally I think it’s awesome bu there’s one problem I have with it. Instead of making custom sounds out of just videos can you make an option where you can use audio files that aren’t from iMusic? Thank you.
5,CATS CATS WAY TO MUCH CATS,Seen this app is free it also has a lot of room to make videos it never ends! And also when I make videos it very helpful so I only use this app to edit because this app is very good and useful
4,sienna ddr,"It’s very annoying that, whenever I’m trying to upload a video it says storage is full. Even though I cleared the cache many times, deleted my whole entire photo album, and even reinstalled the app! (MANY TIMES)  Please fix this! (Or provide a solution to stop or prevent it!!)  -a fellow CapCut user"
5,StarsxComets,"Overall, this is a pretty good app. Editing features, new animation effects, good quality, and a good app to learn how to edit with.  I'd say this is like a stage 2 editing app and Kinemaster is stage 1.   This DEFINITELY needs a drawing feature. Glad I don't need to pay for anything, paying for stuff usually prevents me from learning how to edit and stuff. No bugs that I see, use this app daily to edit videos.  I like the fonts, animations, and all the stuff you can do on here. Not sure why people say its a bad editing software. 10/5 for sure."
5,Flouf🍁,"CapCut is such a great editing app! Weather you are making an edit or just adding text to a video, this is perfect. The only thing I really hope they add is a way to import our own and favorite fonts!"
4,PokémonMaster_CJ,"I have no problem with the app that is besides the fact that animating stickers is the most absurd thing, you think its simple, it only ever works on one sticker, the rest dont work when you press animate and chose an animation it works once then stops i cant figure it out and need help"
5,Kaoruko Kotori,"Honestly, this app is very handy, i make my videos with this app, and its also very convenient to have. At first glance theres really nothing but once you explore more, the more options you have, the best part of it that everythings free, and that theres no watermark!"
3,find email,So I have a new friend and he said he was my first sub so I wanted to make a memorie vid but it keeps saying insufficient storage. Clean up some phone storage and try again but I deleted a few videos that I don’t need but it keeps saying insufficient storage. Clean up some phone storage and try again. that I really don’t like when it says that
4,Jonathan Spears,I like CapCut because your able to do things that other apps that you have to pay to use can’t and it’s free the bad thing is how long it takes to load the video to your camera roll and how when you go off the app it stops but overall it’s pretty good.
4,itsyagirl😂😂,"Hi cap cut!, this app is AMAZING! But I have a small problem it’s the slow mo,if you made the slow mo smooth like video star, I’m sure it will be 5/5 stars, the slow mo needs a lot of effort because if you just wanted a edit with a smooth slow mo it would be perfect if it was smooth , but although I recommend this app!."
5,Jefferson_Phillips,"The app has everything you need to do basic editing on your phone. iMovie for iPhone is nowhere near how good this app is, and it is 100% free, high quality results. I needed to come and leave a comment, they really deserve it for developing such a nice app."
5,ArmourGP,This app gives me the ability to make much better content for people and makes me proud of the things I put out to the public. Go search and look up “Memes_for_the_boysss” on tiktok to see example
5,jacob suchi,Sikeee nothing is wrong with it and I really rec  I’ve been trying to find a editing app then saw this one then downloaded it amd then deleted because i didn’t even know how to edit then I download it again and practice on editing then GoT better I LOVE This APP
5,fhzjfznfgisgl uf,"This app is so great, it’s just that I have an iPhone 11 and when I take a screenshot it shows the full screen. If it does that I’ll have to crop it every time. So can you please add crops you can save and use over and over? Please that would help a lot."
4,girlygalcgamer,"it’s an absolutely fantastic app with great effects and animations but it’s lacking a bit in the text and filter section. it would be great if there was a way to import your own fonts, and a way to upload your own luts/filters/coloring. I would definitely recommend this app though!"
5,killll🔪🔪🔪😭😭😭🖤🖤⛓⛓,Ok so I use CapCut to edit for my tiktoks which is really easy when I use this app but the thing is that when I wanna use the aura affect it doesn’t work and I don't see the affect idk if it’s a gitch or if it’s Bc I’m in an iPad but if u can plss fix it I’m trying to reload the app to see
1,nirvana7762684fan,IT WAS AMAZING! had everything it had moving abilities to move your photo but there is one problem the it doesn’t work after a while you use it after a day or two because it doesn’t work it says that you have no Internet connection I’ve tried other apps and it works with Internet connection it is slow down my phone and taking up a lot of memory so that’s all I have to complain about.
5,🖤Leila💜,"For a few months I’ve been very interested in editing. It took me SOOOOOO long to find and app that was easy to use, I tried apps that made edits for me but they never came out how I wanted them too. CapCut helped a lot! Thank you for making this app it’s the best!"
5,spill the tea🍵,It’s an amazing app I have a recommendation though It would be nice if you could favorite  effects or animations so for if you uses the same one in many of your edits you wouldn’t have to scroll through many animations or effects
5,mâci,"Okay first of all, everything is free, and second of all, it’s good stuff! It’s really good for editing. It’s pretty hard to use, but once you get use to it it’ll be easy. But anyways, if anyone is reading this then u should download this app. Keep up the good work! Have a good day/night ❤️"
5,._.dumb._.h0e,I LOVE THE APP. But I just wish if you added options to edit the transitions so that we can move it a certain way. I also want to make them smooth. Sometimes it glitches but Over all it’s an amazing app. Keep updating it! :)
4,Bailey Hardinger,"Recently when I try to make a smooth slow motion on capcut and I reply the video it acts as if it wasn’t applied at all, and it’s kinda making me a bit upset. But the other option just generally gives me a headache looking at it :/ so please if anyone can help me please do"
5,Pei75,So basically the make it smoother dose not work on me but other people I did not have technical difficulties on CapCut but I can’t tap on the make it smoother. Can you please fix that but I like the app for beginners it’s really good. :)
4,AntsyV,"Cap cut makes editing videos a breeze, the only thing I struggle with, or more so have a problem with is it always says “lost internet connection” when attempting to edit a video with TikTok sounds, unsure when they will address this and fix it."
4,caffeine 2,"Ok I don’t know how many times I’ve reviewed this but THE UPDATE IS MAKING THE TEXT S.L.O.W! Like i adjust it to be faster it will most likely turn very laggy. And technically that’s not with just the text (it’s mostly with the text, but it’s not just the text) it’s with the effects and the text too. Pls fix this.   Have a nice day! ❤️🌹"
4,🤸‍♀️Gym Girl 13,"I love this app! It is so simple to make edits on it. It can be difficult to edit clips because the app often asks you to edit the transitions especially on shorter clips, otherwise a great app! I recommend it to anyone who wants to make videos!"
4,XxCloudziesgurlxX,"Love this app a lot, been using it for a few years, but there’s just ONE thing that ticks me off:when I can’t cut the sound where I need it. I mean I can do it, but I can’t aline that specific part to my edit! It annoys me every time! I’ve gone full anger mode a lot because of this, please fix it!"
5,suyshbyhwbh,This app is bussin bussin but it is hard to tween on it. If you try to tween after moving the overlay a lot it kinda like moves bye it’s self when you try to! But overall CapCut is very good! :) there is velocity for you and most effects are amazing!
5,Hiniko-Chan,I make anime edits and this makes life so much easier! If you love to edit videos or make edits then this is the right app for you! Even if you just are sending an edited video to a friend you could edit the video with ease!! Five out of Five stars!
5,jannakic4,I lost cap cut bc my I phone 6 I had to back up some storage and I didn’t want to delete this at all I loved this so much but I had to and when I try do download it back it would let me do and I’m crying 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😔😔😔😔😔😔 please what should I do to get this cap cut back
5,DogCatPanda,"This is my honest opinion!!  CapCut is the best mobile editing app. It’s easy to use, it’s free, and it has almost everything you need ! I’ve been using it for a while now, and I love it!   The camera effects are great, the video effects are great, the filters are great, the settings are great, the only thing that isn’t great is the slomo!!  The slow mo is choppy and I have to use twixtor or vsco to slow down my videos. That’s the only thing about this app that I will complain about. They need better slowmos!"
5,iiTzYoYo,The app is just amazing in general for editing but I have an idea than can change the way certain people edit… I think you should enable us to animate the masks or to be able to translate it to a certain point
4,LizQ0316,"There’s this problem that happened once but it might happen again so fix it anyways if you could but anyways, there’s this problem where the overlay/text would move on it’s own, that’s all I have to say."
4,puperdoglover,Hello I have been looking for apps and I’ve been using CapCut like forever and I  really want this explode effect and yes other wise you’re app is really good it dose not have anay crashes but sometimes I have to reaload my app to fix them anayway can you add more filters like ascetic ones thank you please write a comment back pls
4,le le butterfly,"The app won’t let me import sounds into my videos for edits, it’s rlly annoying cause I cant do anything, I like to make Roblox edits. It was working when I first got the app, but when I came on a couple of day ago and it wouldn’t work. I deleted and re downloaded it but it didn’t work. So ya….thx."
4,Ashido_Kaminari,I think CapCut is a very good editing app! However when I go to make a video it says “insufficient storage” and I delete a lot of things and it still says that. If you can improve that I’ll definitely like the app a whole lot more but other than that this app is great!
5,😇😁😄😋,CapCut is such a good app for beginners like me! CapCut is an amazing app for me and many others! CapCut comes with so many pre-made effects unlike other apps. CapCut is so easy to figure out. The possibilities are endless! I’d highly recommend this for everyone just learning to edit. 9/10!
4,Coriakin1971,"CapCut is an amazing editing app and I love it so much, but there is one issue I have. Everytime I’m making an edit where each video clip is 0.1 second, I’m trying to watch over them and it go’s rlly slow and glitches. If that could be fixed I’ll give it a 5 star rating!!"
5,gdbdjshsnd,"Hello, I was trying to make an edit on this app as usual, but for some reason it keeps making it 30 minutes and 3 seconds long. I would really recommend you guys checking this out"
5,.ayo_chill,This app is great 100% amazing 🤩 I couldn’t say anything’s wrong but one thing.. ☝🏼it could use better effects. The animations great. But it shouldn’t be called that. Capcut should really add a real animation were you tap a button and you can make your edit animated!! Yes that’s it 😚😚
5,dtdoge,"I love this app because it’s fully free, has no watermarks or ads, and is easy to use! I also really love the Auto-Captions feature as it saves so much time! The only thing I would suggest is having a dark mode for the home menu. Thanks! :)"
5,Karbear7676,"I love CapCut, I use it everyday to make edits and it’s a very good app. One thing I would like to mention is that even if you have no projects or anything else it takes up so much storage, and I don’t know why and it’s very irritating.."
5,@laleniesksk on TikTok,"I absolutely love this app! It’s simple to use, has lots of features, and everything turns out great! It’s so nice because while other apps might get slightly better results, they take forever and are very confusing to use *cough cough VideoStar cough*."
1,afhlfupt,"There is nothing wrong with my phone storage at all I never get any notifications I even check and it says nothing is wrong but it keeps saying crap about my storage, this is getting very annoying I will delete this app and try and download it again to see if anything got fixed. NO nothing even worked and it won’t let me edit stuff. This app used to be so fun but now it keeps talking about problems that aren’t happening😑"
5,the_gabby_shownhhsgccccc,This app is so great and I love how you don’t have to pay to remove the water mark this app deserves more love because this app is AMAZING I highly recommend if you can’t use any editing app because you are broke and can’t pay for transitions pick this app it is such a good app!
5,deez big nuts on your mom face,This app has everything! It’s just needs a few more fire transitions and the Picture in Picture feature and it would be hands down the number one app on the AppStore.
4,@kittycute123456,Hi if ur seeing this please add mores songs! I know u have a lot but there’s not a lot of songs with words . And if u add more can j add like the songs that are more recommended because it’s bugging me because I don’t make music videos because of this. Thank you please fix these have a good day/ night
5,misaki hyuga,The app is great I’ve been using it for quite awhile but until now the style option for photos isn’t popping up and I can’t do my edits so I don’t know if you guys can fix that. Have a good day/night.
5,BrawlStarsFan1020,"People are saying it is bad but it really isn't. It is completely free, and you can remove the watermark. Like I said, it is FREE. You downloaded a free app. Of course there is bugs. But it is an amazing app overall and I use it to edit all of my videos"
5,iannna23,"It’s a great app that has made my life much easier, I would always end up downloading a bunch of random editing apps that would do the bare minimum. It’s simple to use, basically all the tools are free, and it does leave a watermark."
2,amzad9011,I’m giving this app 2 stars due to the fact that i cannot add any audio i have recorded and saved from a voice memo app to my videos i make here because it is silent and i cannot hear the audio on playback. I used to use this app all the time to help me make my announcement videos but now i cannot  Please fix this bug
5,for Geisha!!!,"I think this app is very well developed. One suggestion I have is to make it possible to manually delete the background, as sometimes it doesn’t work properly and crops the wrong thing. Thanks!"
4,chirsmis,This app makes me want to DIE it has good features and stuff but the slow Mo is always glitchy. i get that they fixed it but it won’t just happen for me. The templets SHOUKD be removed. NO ONE USES THEM well some people do but still. They are also very bad so PLS PLS PLS remove them. Take my review as a REASON to remove templates 😘
3,jdhs difhem,"Hello my name is Michael and I am a user of cap cut, Now on to the point in the latest update the smoother slow motion is no working for me as when it is loading it loads fast until u get 50% then that’s when mines stops I’m not sure if anyone else is going through the same issue as me but ya I hope someone sees this and this Michael, have a good day and/or night."
4,hello UwU ♡☆,"I've been using this app for about two years and its a really good editing app, especially for beginners. Theres a lot that can be done with this app, but theres some problems about it..  1. The graphs arent working.  I was trying to edit a video and zooming in and then putting graphs, but for some reason instead of zooming in, it just zooms out instead?  2. My projects keep getting deleted.  Sometimes when I'm making a video, then close out the app (i saved the project btw) then when I go back on the app, my project is gone.  3. My templates keep getting corrupted."
5,GachaAngelWolf,"I am tired of using other apps! This editing app is the best I have used! Other apps never work and too complicated, but in this one it is so easy I can create a video in less than two minutes!"
5,30haf,CapCut is amazing for beginners and you can do pretty much anything getting to start it can be a little confusing but other wise it’s a really good app I’m giving a 5 star I highly recommend and the best part is it’s free keep up the good 😊
1,A Real One,I use to love this app and I gave it 5 stars but this recent update will not allow me to do anything it keeps asking to get permission to access my photo library and there is not option to do so. When I click the settings button it only shows me tabs that do not allow me to give the app access. So until this is fixed the app will receive a 1 star rating until I can use it again.
4,HeyyItsBree,"Overall, CapCut is an amazing app! It has great potential! I really like the stickers and the effects. And, it doesn’t have a watermark. But, I wish you were able to add more layers since I am an animator. Other than that, there are not any other problems that occur while I use this app."
4,missawooch,"Love the app. Just recently purchased a generation 6 iPad, due to lack of storage on phone. My only problem is there isn’t availability for 2/4k quality when Saving like their is on my iPhone. Is this due to my iPad being a few years old?"
5,pitbull_lover0609,This is the best editing app I have used EVER! I 100% recommend it has soooo many options and all for FREE. I am a influencer on Tik Tok and I love that I can use my tik tok sounds on it! It comes with so many stickers and fonts and I think that this would be a great app for you to download
5,Melanie Playzz,"I really like this app because it has everything i needed in a editing app, Other editing apps I downloaded were just not for me. So i think you should download this app if you are looking for a editing app to use!!"
4,Lemony🤍,I love this app! It is perfect for making edits or memes or anything like that. It works 100% correctly but the TikTok audio picker or whatever it's called is not working. It keeps telling me I don't have my internet on even though I do. Can you please fix that? Thank you! 🤍
4,karafunk,"Hi I’m just gonna say that this is my personal fave editing app ive ever used. My problem is: when I need more storage i have to delete stuff, so I did and it didn’t work so i threw away some pretty good content if you could fix that i would highly appreciate that. Thanks!"
3,kaunicorngirl415,Ive had this before with Kinemaster  so i switched to CapCut the Kinemaster issue got fixed randomly but no matter what i do i can’t get it to use photos or videos when i go into the privacy thingy in settings al it says is that any apps that request photo access will be there but CapCut isn’t there
4,Kitorill,Add a motion blur effect so the slow motion when i lower the speed looks more smooth and same thing when i make the speed high. or change a part of the velocity to make itnlook smooth during those moments
4,Sandi539,"The sound doesn’t work when extracted most of the time, I had to re-download the app. Even so, the audio isn’t working... Please resolve this issue CapCut. I’ll be deleting this and using another app. I would love if you could fix this weird glitch. Thank you. ❤️"
5,yay-789,I made so many videos but then one day it stopped I deleted the app and reinstalled it but it still didn’t work I cried for a little bit because I made so many videos I loved and there gone
3,GetNo0b,"It’s really great for editing, I use it a lot, but the thing is, it needs a lot of storage. I will make an edit, and it won’t let me save the edit, so I delete some stuff, but then it won’t even let me open the edit because I “don’t have enough storage. I have deleted a lot of good videos & photos just to save a small video."
4,Cozmo Fam,"Honestly, this is a really good editing app. I would totally recommend it. Although, I do think that they should add a search bar to search for the animations. It becomes repetitive to always have to scroll though all the animations and find the one that you want to use"
5,justjeremyy,I think there should be like a velocity edit option like basically you import audio then you select it and select the beat style and then the effects and then done!
5,#savecapcut👈,As a person that has used CapCut for so long it was fun and easy but I stopped and switched because when you slow the speed down it’s so laggy and glitchy so please try to fix the slow motion;)
4,👩‍🦲🤚,"I really enjoy this app, it’s super easy to use and there’s no watermark! the end does have something that says “capcut” but you can delete that from your video, the animations are also very easy to use! I’ve tried using other apps like Video Star and it was very confusing. Also CapCut is free!"
5,space.child7,"One of the best editing apps out there, I just started editing and this makes it so easy and fun! Practically everything is free and I learned how to use it all by myself, not complicated at all. I’m always satisfied with the product too! :)"
4,lyssalily101,"It’s a great app and the animations are awesome. But my phone begins to overheat whenever I play the video and I have to continue replaying the video to make a sure things are even, however it just makes my phone hot. I’m not sure if that’s my phone but I recently got this phone so I’m not sure"
5,𝙳𝚊𝚛𝚔 𝙿𝚑𝚘𝚎𝚗𝚒𝚡,"This app is just awesome. I love to edit but never found a good app to use! When l found CapCut l decided to try it.   I was blown away. The transitions are smooth and super pretty, you can add your own audio, pictures etc. I recommend this app 100%. Trust me, you’ll be satisfied."
5,Sophia😝❤️🥋🐺,I like to edit a lot and this is by far my favorite app to edit it’s free and it has no watermark but it would be nice if maybe we can make are own transitions? Just a suggestion 🤗 but this is the best free editing app I 100% recommend . Have a nice day / night 💃🏻
5,dise it work?,This app is so handy and neat I love it so much it has so much to discover and surprises lol I did I vid in capcut and I got on it 12M likes omg can u BELIVE it?!?!???!!! This app is the best like seriously u must use it it’s the best and editing and it tells u where are the stuff as I said sooo handy I love this app so so so so so so so so so muchhhh I use it DÂILY cause I love it 😍😍😇😇😌😌😌😌
5,uSEr15738629,This app is amazing without hidden subscription requirements. It’s very easy and intuitive to use! It has everything I need to make cute small videos for my social media. I would recommend this for everyone.
5,The Floor Lamp,"Ok, I have been looking for this app FOREVER now! I needed an app that could turn a videos audio into audio and do great transitions, well I found a pile of shiny gold! I haven’t been using the app for too long but this is by far the best one I have used!"
5,OfficialFabian,the app is great better than most apps and easy to use. its free and its amazing. i have 2  of recommendations so i thought of writing them here! 1:more animations for videos and text 2:fix frozen glitch; the video slows down and it freezes.
4,54Manuel28,"So I love the smooth option for it, it really looks good but when you put it on some clips there’s a green light on it that will flash and it ruins the edit, and the smooth option and slow motion is a bit buggy, please fix it thank you."
5,iAnonymoususerx,"Maybe add a puppet feature? Like for example, you have a picture of a video game character, and the feature would allow you to move any of the body parts."
5,Alainacoles,"I really enjoy CapCut! It’s easy to edit, and you and everything is free! Also, I really like how when you publish it, it doesn’t have a watermark! I really like editing on CapCut. It’s one of the best editing apps I have ever experienced. Thank you dearly. If I could rate CapCut 100, I would! Best. App. Ever!"
5,Griffinrider1,I’m in love with this app it is a easy to use free editor with great effects and is add free would definitely recommend if your new to editing or have been editing for a long time it has honestly made my videos look 10x better
5,Laypoe,"I haven’t experienced all the features yet. BUT DAM it’s awesome, and I have like 6 different video editor apps. This is one of the best so far. Only give it a four, since I haven’t experienced it very much yet, I’ll give 5 starts later once I fully understand it."
3,cant_live_without_idk,"For some reason my CapCut is always showing I have no internet connection, even though I do. And I have tired fixing it and nothing has worked. I have re downloaded the app, updated and everything to try to fix it and it still won’t let me."
3,Ah'Neira Peterson,"Almost all the time a I make videos on CapCut, when it says I have to much videos and or pictures I delete the photos and the videos until I don’t see any. Once I have ZERO videos and photos capcut just says I STILL don’t have enough storage, I delete my capcut videos, STILL NO STORAGE! I mean I love capcut but I think that it either is my iPad or the app."
5,jjujoop,Overall I love everything about this app it’s just that capcut needs to read their customers reviews and fix bugs or make updates (sorry for bad English)
4,Brady Guthrie,"This app has pretty much anything a content creator would need but i have noticed a strange bug in the app… i dont know if its just me or its the app but for some reason when i go to upload a photo into a project it shows none of my photos please get back to me and respond - Sincerely, Brady Guthrie"
4,Mrs. Jack-Daniel 💕,"i love this app so much, and i have been using it for a while, but there are a few things i’d like, for example, a fricking drop shadow. it seriously can’t be that hard, just a shadow  on overlays. i downloaded vs (video star) just for the shadow, only to realize they make you PAY FOR MULTIPLE LAYERS????!!! ok yeah um add the drop shadow and i’ll be happy 😅"
5,zjct10,"This app is amazing perfect quality and good for editors. I was a bad editor until i came across this amazing app. Very good i need to update it so i can have the smooth quality on the bottom, please help! Although amazing."
5,arisocool1,This app is so amazing they just recently added auto velocity edit. In one click you can have a whole velocity!!!!!! This is by far my favorite part. It does take a bit of time to get used to the app but it is really cool.
5,super_elaine,This app is so Good it’s easy to edit on here you don’t have to pay for hardly anything they have dope effects exportation is super easy and it doesn’t have a big fat water mark covering the screen when you export. Get this app!
4,-1 no nickname,"It’s a good app and all but the only thing you guys need to fix is the glitching part, when you cut and edit, it does this slow glitch thing. It would be a 5/5 if it wasn’t so glitchy. Everyone it’s a good app, a free one to, but they have a fix a few things."
4,Av3ry Allen,Everything is great and I love the transitions but for some reason I can’t see certain effects and transitions other people can see I’m really confused and I have been trying to use certain ones but they never show up even if my CapCut is up to date
5,Flre_fox,"I got this back in like march around there it was a little hard at first but I started actually trying and it ended up being one of my favorite editing app I’ve had, I recommend this app"
5,Banana o-o,This app is so easy to understand All of my friends and I use this app The effects are great and the songs are just spot on I recommend this app if your starting or if your already good at editing It is the best 😁
3,LittleC1121,"I was using it right- so after a long while it said I didn’t have storage so I fixed it and then it says: Capcut requires access to the album for editing and saving videos. So I click confirm and it goes to settings and there is literally no button to give it access, I cant use the app now, please fix this!!"
5,Suspects_13,"I really love this app. The editing effects are great and stuff, but I have a suggestion for the audio or video. I was hoping maybe you could add a reverb affect. There can be different kinds. I rate this app a 10/10 anyway"
5,Mad.w,I love this app. It’s really easy to use and it’s free unlike some other editing apps. It doesn’t put a watermark like funimate does and you can save it to your device for free as well. My favorite editing software you should really download it :))
3,Bhehjehwj iis huh we,"Okk the good things I like about this app is that there stuff u do not have to pay for and there’s  multiple  ways/things uu can do to design ur edit, a few things I don’t like is that we have the same effects for a long time and this app run out of storage to much it would very much better if uu guys give us more space!!"
5,Bree Bree the gamer,I have really no Complaints and there is one thing it gets super laggy if i edit for a while but other than that there is really nothing wrong with this app and i hope you can fox that minor issue
4,your local weeb/ anime fan,I mean it’s okay it’s just I am having a problem with whenever im importing a photo. After I exit the project or insert one ( I don’t really know this glitch is confusing) I can’t insert another photo and Half the thing I need to do on here is insert photos and this glitch really isn’t helping so 4 out of 5
5,basically a QUEEN,So I make gacha videos and edits and I deleted kinemaster and switched to CapCut and all I have to say is that I am so happy I did. I love CapCut because it gives many options. If you are thinking of downloading this app you really should.  Thanks for your time reader
4,rat king ✨,This app is great! I’ve been using it to make edits and it’s very easy to learn and use! One thing I’m hoping you guys add is graphs between key frames! It would really help a lot of people with smooth videos :D Also more transitions and possibly the ability to make our own?? Thanks!
4,mason_hdz,The only reason why i give capcut 4 stars is because i would really like a graph for keyframes it would be really useful when putting my own little details in the edit. So far i have no complains about the app its my number one app to edit videos!
4,RainbowKittens404,I love CapCut and use it for my Tik toks everyday! But I have ran into a few problems... there is a max overlay..? Take a moment to think about how STUPID that is. I was working on something abd I need more overlays and now I have to start all over. It’s kinda frustrating. Overall though the app is pretty good and underrated.
5,El ⛅️,"I have a HP account where I make edits, and this app is perfect! I can’t recommend it more. My only issues is sometimes the chromakey tool in overlays is a little glitchy, and I wish there was a way to favorite or mass apply animations to save time."
4,&.)&//8/8:737:7:7.&.&,So the app works fine it’s just that for the past 2 weeks I for some reason can’t put text or a overlay. I can click things like the canvas or audio button but just not those 2. I’ve done everything to but nothing works.
5,Mus6d,Don’t get me wrong this app is PERFECT but I have some suggestions that could make it better.  - Make it available on PCs  - More tools for the chrome key effect so we can adjust the green screen and not get the fuzzy stuff. - More filters or color correction  - Fix the volume problem where when we lower it down it barely goes down - Audio effects  - Import audio or video from other apps like google drive and documents  I hope you guys take my suggestions and thank you for an amazing app
3,Jenn_1517,"I’m a Chinese living abroad and I’m only able to download this international version of the app, which does’t have the option of generating auto-captions for Chinese like the Mainland China version. It always takes FOREVER to manually input the captions. Please add this function to the international version to make it more user friendly for Chinese overseas!!!!!"
3,cmvsm,"I really love this app when it works for me but this has happened multiple times where I’ve had to delete a lot of a photos. For some reason it says I cannot make a video because I have no storage, I deleted all the photos I could but still no luck. Please fix this if this is happening to anyone else."
5,𝚈𝚘𝚒𝚗𝚔,"Hello, I'll give a 5 stars but the thing is about this idea that the key frames, even though it's at low or high space it goes slower than I thought it was, I think you can update that a little bit more, thank you!"
4,JasperBanks,"I tend to use this app quite a bit but as of lately, when I export the video the video is a little off sync with the audio. The video in the player looks fine but when I save it, it is off and does not look good. Pls fix."
5,keklordlogan,The best you can get on iOS! I only have one request is that there should be a green screen function with the overlay. I have been looking for an app that works this good for a while and its free! I would recommend this app to anyone who does any kind of editing.
4,Cassidyluvswildwood,"I have deleted almost every app in my phone and deleted almost every photo I have, but it still says insufficient storage when I try to download a 35 second video. Idk if this is a big but is very annoying. Please fix this."
3,MiamiSebo,"I’ve been using CapCut for 6 months now and I’ve been getting better . I’ve been really using Auto Velocity on Style but recently I haven’t found Style on my screen . I tried closing the app and opening it to see if that works but no it doesn’t .    Can you guys help me with this situation ,please ?"
3,samanthuha,wonderful app 10:10 on everything except it sometimes tells me i dont have enough storage (i do tho!!!!) and it wont let me import my videos for some reason :( i usually just restart my phone and itll work but it hasnt been. i really dont wanna switch app this is such a fun and easy app but its making it hard. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!
5,Mom to beee,Because it is soooo helpful this is the first editing soft ware i used and it’s easy and simple one time I needed to make a vid with ALOT of green screens but it took me just one second and the video turned out perfectly.
3,Roula,"This app is amazing! Everything about it is very helpful for beginners but there is this glitch that always happens to me and its very annoying, Its with the scale, I slightly zoom in and it zooms in all the way in, and if I slightly move the scale it starts over again and its very annoying But other than that this is a very good app!"
5,alexusradecke,This app is amazing I love it so much and I do my edits on cap cut and I think I’ve had cap cut for maybe for like a year or two and I’ve gotten better at my edit’s from when I first started editing but go download cap cut this app is wonderful!!’
4,Sad potato bag,"this app is good when it comes to simple edits but if theres one thing that i think lots of people would LOVE to have is smooth slow motion and/or a velocity effect or something velocity related, as well as some good quality too! other than that, this app is great👍🏽"
5,ur mom😍😍😍,This is a good editing app for beginners and it is free most editing apps ask you to pay money for certain affects when you can just download Cap cut cause it gives you what other apps make you pay for but for free
4,miojoko,I love this app but after a while of using it it won’t let me change the opacity of the text I put am not sure if that makes sense but it won’t let me change it and it’s really bugging me and I don’t know what to do about it please help or try to fix it:/
5,jfvfhdbdjjfbdjdnchcjdbdhd,So I love using capcut to edit my videos but now when I pressed make new project it didn’t let me capcut is the easiest thing I use to edit my videos please fix this pls!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭  P.S fix this or I will find where you live and destroy you👿😈👺
4,Kim Zing,"Ok overall, I love this game; but there’s one big weird bug that must be fixed. When you download and go to graphs, there’s a big text that you can’t get rid off and it says “Use Graphs to customize transitions between key frames” You can’t tap on any graph mechanics. Please fix it"
5,KeelCal,"So I was opening capcut, and it said “capcut needs access” but in setting it only has siri. It’s been 20 minutes and still. I need to post on stuff but even those apps don’t work. Or can someone help me?"
5,pinky-123,The only thing I wish for is to be able to import the same pictures without having to leave the media option-
5,_ok_hello_,"Honestly I love it, I used many edit apps and they weren’t good. It’s easy to use and it’s cool I have just 1 complaint, you need internet to edit anything, but other then that, I love this app so much🤍💕I totally recommend it!"
5,Mai chi Tonnu,"This is a very great app for me to edit videos for many things! It has no watermark for me for free! I love it as much, I will be able to edit more things than ever! I suggest downloading it! It has cute stickers too! This also helps with my intro!"
5,???Secert???,"I love this app I have been using it for a while and I have almost mastered this app but I would like there to be a little more advanced stuff added to capcut like more advanced transitions,animations and effects possibly? If that is a thing :)"
5,hsksnsha has,"In my opinion, Capcut is the best beginner app, there is many presets for those who don’t know how to use keyframes. You can do so much with this app I definitely recommend this for starters, This is my only editing app I use so I recommend getting this app!"
5,hdjdodhdkskgdhsksjxbsn,Short cus me lazy really easy to use I love making Gacha club videos I love the effects and music you can use i like making videos of me and my friends although it would be nice if you could add texts to a video otherwise I love it
4,Callie Robbins,I give it four because I think that the app couldn’t use an update and the tutorial to I see many people who use the app and have much better edits than me and I don’t know how because it’s not in the tutorial but otherwise it’s is the best free editing app
5,dogs rainbow cats,When ever I have storage I always have to delete photos when it works on other apps so please if there’s anyway you can help or do anything please let me know
4,arxiste,I love using capcut so much but ever since the new update I couldn’t lower the opacity for my text anymore. It was swapped out with “size” on the text settings. I still love the app and I’m still going to use it but  i wish they still had the opacity setting:(
5,Camlol123,you can use it for like edit for everything you’re not like eating what’s not on your phone it’s food and like waking up you can’t do that on CapCut so I’m not talking about like everything everything and yeah it’s really awesome
5,dancing_keys,"This app has upped my game in everything internet related.  -no watermark -no premium version -generally good effects -very well made -easy to use -OVERLAYS :) -movable overlays! -so many audio options -extractable audio  This is a great app! I wish you could tween in it, but overall it’s wonderful! It’s was obviously worked very hard on and isn’t just a cash grab. Best editing app I’ve ever downloaded.  Edit: so if discovers that when I escort things the audio is off timing. This is pretty annoying, but tbh it doesn’t ruin the app for me :)"
5,🤟🏻🤞🏻🖖🏻👐🏻🤲🏻,"I love CapCut so much it’s an amazing editing app, it has so many filters and things you can do on it. I think the only bad thing about this app is that it can get really slow sometimes. I really think that CapCut deserves 5 stars."
2,RubyHappy3,Don’t get me wrong this app is perfect but the problems for me are that sometimes when I open up my edit and press play to review what I just did it skips everything and shows some clips of what I did and Aldo before I can start my project it says my storage is full even tho cap cut is the only app I have so that’s what really triggers me please find a way to stop these ridiculous glitches
5,RacerPro44,So I downloaded video star I thought it’s very good for editing it wasn’t then I asked my friends what app is good for editing they told me capcut I didn’t believe them at first but it’s actually worked out and it’s very good for editing thank you so much.<3
3,imreallyhp,I love this app for editing it’s easy and simple but I’ve been having some glitches where it glitches when I moving frame to frame and I can can’t edit like that because I can’t get the perfect beat drop when I can’t see on which frame to do it pls fix the bugs that the app is having please and thanks 🤝
5,ayeblaze,"I love everything about this app, I love how every asset and feature is free. One idea though, for the animations, let us be able to make our own combos instead of the preset ones we already have, if you add this, then the app will be perfect"
5,kdsbdosnkakakakk,It’s so good and it has soooo much and it doesn’t have the little premium which I like because I feel like we should have a lot and it is so cool how the editing is in this app so I would definitely pick this one over any else one
4,qwryubgdk,This has been one of the best editing apps I have ever had for iOS. But every once and a while a video I try editing just breaks and won’t work with anything. It also takes up way to much space.
4,sharkqueen_3,Ok so I wanted to make a video for gacha and when I went to go create a new project it said I need access to the album and I have 10 other projects and nothing shows up in settings. I’m really confused and it would really help if you could explain it to me.
5,Editior2.0,"This app is the best editing app I have used. I also love that everything is free, you usually need to pay for most of the other editing apps to get special effects, advantages, etc. That is why I really like this app."
5,MasterReviewZ,It’s so good <3 at the current state I’ve used it for weeks and it has not once asked for my money in fact I’m not sure if you have to pay for anything at all! Best on the market! I am so greatly pleased.
5,hisokasimp101,I love this app but I’m curious of why the auto velocity effect isn’t popping up for me even after I updated can you please respond because I don’t wanna delete and download it back and lose my data
4,Cre C.,"I love this app: it helps me cut vids together. I DO wish that it had more effect sounds, but overall, amazing. My brother and my sis ask me to put vids of their games and activities into a cool video and with this app, I can do that. I can even put pics of memes like the emotional damage meme into my videos."
3,jihyosbestie,So basically I saw this TikTok that there was a new feature on CapCut that was named “light dynamic “ or however you call it. So I went to see if it was there and no it wasn’t and then I tried update it and I pressed style and I was still wasn’t there and I’m so confused? Why isn’t it there a bunch people said to update it but it isn’t there?
3,Mccoy E.,It’s a great app I love using it to edit but how come it says no internet when I have internet. It gets annoying I would have to uninstall the app and reinstall it just to get it to work again and even the give it a few days and it’s back at it again with the no internet crap. Why is that???
1,sdhrsi,When I get home from school and I’m not going back home I’m just trying not sleep until tomorrow morning I can go to eat later I have a lot to eat and I’m just trying my hardest and I’m just going back home and I can’t eat my bad lol I just woke my heart lol lol I’m not doing it now I’m going back to bed now I’m going back to bed lol I just woke you I love love you for too long I hope you are ok I can’t sleep well I woke up and woke woke up this morning woke woke up and I got up to die lol
4,Le very cool potatoe,"This is app is nice and a genuinely good for editing, but the thing is that it told me, “Cant make video because you have insufficient storage” or something. I delete like a hundred or so pics and videos, but nothing happened. Is it something wrong with me or the app??   -confused"
5,try again loser14,It is the best thing ever it took me some time to learn how the app specifically worked but after I did it was great. I had issues with uploading audios but then I figured it out. Overall this app has been great and captured great memories!
5,qrbwt,At first i was a little skeptical because i have never edited anything but i got reasonably better and better until I felt like it was an everyday thing thank you for capcut it is amazing
5,not bad 🥴 kinda INOING,I’ve been having this app for a long time but as soon I made more videos  it said MY STORAGE WAS FULL! So I had to clean up my storage so when I came back to the app it still said that I had to clean up my storage!
5,zoooëë,"capcut is by far my all time favorite editing app for sure. it’s fairly easy to navigate, which is super handy for me. my favorite feature is extracting audio from a video file in your galary, which is so useful. i think i’ve used khinemaster, imovie, and capcut. capcut is definitely my first choice for sure. i’m not sure i have any complaints for the app, saying it’s got pretty much all i need. i’m so glad i switched to capcut! especially sense it’s free and you don’t have an annoying water mark."
5,|-|3@7+|_3$$,"I love the app all I came here for is to suggest something, a movement tracker!!! Like when a person or oc moves the screen or whatever will move along with it!!! It makes things smoother! Also motion blur ! That’ll help a lot with edits or Gacha videos !"
4,Vlone.Daniel,"I don't necessarily find this a problem but genuinely it bothers me a little, i have an iphone 11 and every time i try to swipe the opacity bar i end up swiping to another app and it gets annoying maybe if y'all were to raise it a bit or do something with it?"
5,sheanica,"Hi so I love CapCut and its my only editing app. But can you please add keyframes. Because most apps that include keyframes are too expensive and if you don’t mind, please make it free. Also, Please make the speed thing smoother and to get better quality. Thank you so much!"
3,13dxddys,So I was bored wanting to edit something and I did but it say my storage is full but I just cleaned it  pls fix this it’s not fair to me and pls fix this glitch also I was gunna edit a vid Imma make in roblox if u don’t know what roblox is search it it’s a game where u play with ur friends and make cool avatars but I liked 2017 style.. but whatever pls fix this !!
5,Meawscals,This app is the best editing app I have ever seen it’s free and amazing. I usually used KineMaster but it got annoying because all the adds saying get out subscription and when I do the edits they wipe out all of my progress so I’m so glad I came across this app is is the best.
5,hdhdhd siqjs,"I just started editing, and it’s so fun using this app. It’s give me something to do when I’m at home. CapCut is a super good app to use. It’s has really good images and effects. This app is really good and everyone should get it if they want to learn how to edit. ❤️"
3,L. D. R,"Every time I wanna download my videos it says “This is too much storage for your phone, please try and cleaning up” Like- I deleted all my game apps just to download my videos and that does not help. So I have to delete my edits that I did, witch was sad bc it Took so long to do my edits. Yet, I had to delete for A dam video that has A FANCAM LIKE JUST A FANCAM. Please CapCut fix it!! Overall it’s pretty nice"
5,julianna is so cool,The app its really good! But make the keyframes more like moveable and add graphs. Its really easy to use! But like try to make it a bit more hard i been using capcut for 1/2 years but i havent been able to be like other editors like have graphs.
5,An anime artist,"Not gonna lie, this is probably the best video/picture editing app I have ever used. I tried KineMaster, but it was too complicated. I used VLLO for a while, but it took up too much storage. This app is just perfect for pros and beginners, I highly recommend it. ❤️"
5,🥀🥺👍🏻,"This app is so poggers! I love it! No watermark which makes my life easier, And the transitions aren’t crappy at all! I was finally able to do the sugar crash trend, but it’s dead 💀 I would Probably recommend CapCut to smaller youtubers who like making edits! My new fav editing app ❤️💖"
3,nickie tha kitty 🌸,"when i try to make a new project it tells me i don’t have enough storage. i deleted over 2,000 photos and videos from my device and it still says that. i checked my storage and i have barley used any. when i got it to work it was amazing but after that it stoped working again"
5,Iqbal NYC,"everything is great with this app and I love the no water marks and that it is 100% free, though I do have some suggestions: add graphs! graphs help edits be smoother and less choppy. add coloring! coloring is to color photos/videos. that’s all I have to suggest right now!"
5,YodaelG,"I’ve waited for such a long time looking for a video editing app where the user interface was easy to use, super quick and clean. I’ve literally shared and recommended to so many of my friends I love it... rly fast way for editing TikTok’s"
5,Ineednmae,I love this app ever since I first had it it has helped me so much and before I even started using vs this is what would help me sharpen my clips add some masking and multiple layers for when I had vsf and the blending helps so much this is the best experience <3
5,starpinces99870,"The fact that this is free and works just as well as the paid editing apps is amazing! You see, I’m a minor who doesn’t have a job and my parents will never pay for editing apps. So this is a blessing on the earth!"
4,snugglesthecat 1,It’s a great app for editing but it uses a lot of data and space which I hate a lot because I had to delete a lot of pictures so I think that needs help but overall it’s pretty great for edits and there’s no water marks but please work with the space and data problem
4,catixy,"I LOVE this app , there is no watermark , everything is completely free and easy to use , I am just having trouble with the audio , when I try to extract one it make me wait a lot and then it doesn’t get the audio , so if you can please fix this it will be awesome."
5,mimibeachy,"Ok first this is the best editing app in the whole world, now time for the suggestions So when I’m editing my thing glitches a lot the video will stay at one part of it and wont move. But great app."
4,Anna Rosencrantz,I would give this amazing editing app a five star but I wish there was some other added features and effects but that isn’t their fault. However this is an amazing editing app that doesn’t even have a watermark! I now use this app for most of my edits.
5,Madyson Myer,"I LOVE this app so much, it teaches me so much. Something that would be nice would be a folder I could put my edits into that are easy to get to and if I need to move edits around to different folders it would be much easier and help me stay organized!"
5,opolopl,"CapCut has wonderful effects and filters. I saw a lot of TikTok users use this app. The effects and animations are 100% free. Other editing apps have price on effects and animation, but CapCut is total free. Try this app and you’ll wanna keep it! I have a TikTok and I use this app for editing! Thanks, CapCut"
4,qregsvsysg,I really wanted to do an edit with the volocity thing and I couldn’t find the Style button. I searched up many options instead of using a VPN. I tried and all of them didn’t work. Can you please fix this?
5,TIK TOK 2020 is the best,This app is that really wonderful app it’s really good for editing vids they are also like better than Funimate no hate you could even put someone’s add it on top of yours or something like that LOL- I know that doesn’t make sense but something like that
5,Whytfdoweneedaname,I personally think that this app is amazing! There’s no watermark and there’s lots of really good transitions and effects! I think that this is the best free app for edits and more b I just think that you should be able to tween but overall this app is the best I’ve ever had 😁
5,Every nickname is uuse,This app is such a good use if your all about editing videos AND photos! I use this so much and it helps a lot! One of the best things about this app is that all the effects are free! I would recommend this app to people that absolutely ENJOY and LOVE editing!
5,~Blue*Berry~,So.. I have an issue where I like using bling effects and I hate watermarks and I was using kinemaster premium... I found this and it has so many effects and text ideas no watermark no premium or anything !!!
5,Fireanime_,"Whenever I try to use the bling effect it says that I have no internet connection. Is there anyway to fix this? Other than that this app is phenomenal, the only app I use to edit my videos!"
5,cloudyxdummy on tiktok,"THIS APP IS INCREDIBLE!!! nothing cost money and it works like a dream, this is way less time consuming than video star, I highly recommend this, I have made edits so easily and better than ever on this app, 4.5 stars is underrated"
5,kkgirly_12,"i’ve had this app for years, yes years. Maybe around two. it’s such a great app if you know how to use it and i must say it’s very easy to learn how. great edits have came out of this. thank you for making this app !"
4,oropeza tejon,"I really like capcut and I like using it for edits but for some reason the reverse button doesn’t work, it used to work but now it doesn’t?? I already redownloaded it already and it still doesn’t work. I hope y’all can fix it."
3,ladygirk,"Hey CapCut I have a question for you guys..why did y’all remove the velocity thing this made your app more popular and now we have to make it our selves and this is gonna make your app mostly become unpopular,so I probably recommend potting the velocity effect back pls and thank you have a nice day :)"
4,hdis In iddbdndhd,This app os so easy to use. I would recommend for editing beginners. The only downfall it has is on some phones the updates are slow getting to you I still don’t have some things other people have otherwise this app is amazing!!!
4,baddie moment,"well first of it takes up a whole lot of storage and some times lags, other wise the app is good for beginners pretty easy to use. And they come out with good updates which im looking forward for the future ones."
5,NightRowBlastYT,You know when you zoom in to certain parts of the video. Sense the update that feature is glitching out
2,goosy loosy,"everytime i try to go on capcut it always says “Insufficient storage” 👎 so i go over to my setting and managed my storage until i have **2 FRICKING GIGABYTES** 😭😭 and it still says insufficient storage 😓😓 left so i go over to my photos and DELETE 😩😩every single of my 10,000 photos until i finally have 1 **gigabyte** left 😓😓  it still says insufficent storage flip this thing im uninstalling this rip my photos"
4,ihaTeU127610,"First of all, I love this app, but there is one huge problem with it. When I connect my TikTok account for the audios, it will not show any of the recent audios I have favorited. I have redownloaded the app multiple times and still nothing has worked. PLEASE FIX!"
4,DF Is Daddy,I love the app easy to use got a lot of features but my option to add tiktok sounds stopped working after one day with the message “no internet connection try again later” and it’s been a month or so and it’s still not working
3,ssosososoo,so problem number 1:VIDEO TOO SHORT I DONT WANT TO CHANGE IT I WANT TO CHANGE SPEED number 2:the literal cut button I always press the video and it won’t make me change speed I took 2 hours changing it problem number 3:the video button it never works but that’s all I had to say for 3 but please fix those bugs
5,Kailee Goodman,I used this app to make my first edit and it turned out nice and didn’t take me too long to learn. it’s not too fancy but it has everything you need without a price. don’t change pls ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
4,Cheeeeessee,CapCut is amazing! I love this app so much and edits look so good afterwards. CapCut had a issue for to where I could only insert pictures videos and add text. I could not do anything else but gladly I’m trying to fix it with an update. If it does not work I hope it will later but overall it’s a great app!
5,jickbuck,"So I accidentally deleted Capcut and I had like 45+ edits on there!! Is there any way I could retrieve them all? On the other hand, Capcut is a very very good app! I use it for all my edits and it’s pretty simple to use. If there’s any way to retrieve my edits, please tell me. Thank you!"
3,madelyn😎😇,I love the game its fun to use since i know how to edit but… one day It said “CapCut requires to the album editing and saving videos” i press confirm and takes me to my settings  and doesn't show me where to go! Please help.. :( i just wanted to edit a video for a friend for her birthday her birthday was 3 days ago i feel really bad!  So please help where do i go!
4,Puppycat611,"I love how many options their are when you edit your videos, however when it says “insignificant storage” I delete at least 6 videos that I loved, but it still says “insignificant storage” which I am not pleased about."
5,pls and thank you!,Ok I love this app so much but I think there could be a few tweaks to it. One I feel like the max overlays should be like 12 instead because I was doing rlly well and then it said max overlays•-• two maybe more filter options
4,letmesenddd,"The app itself is amazing. I use is almost everyday to edit my videos. But when I add the same video I already added, it changes. For example, I import a video, and I adjust the video and import it again. The first time I imported it, it changes to the clip I adjusted which I HATE."
4,sjdjdjsbdvxjdbfjxjbdjxbfjxbdjd,"This app is a really good app, o really enjoy making velocity edits on here and others types to... and I don’t want to sound rude but what really annoys me is that it keeps telling me that I don’t have enough storage even though I deleted so many apps, pictures, and drafts just so I can save the video"
2,iPhoneUser712,"Good for editing… when the app wants to work. Sometimes when I pick what photos/videos to use it says it couldn’t load it. And I try many things to make it work— starting a new project, reopening the app, resetting my phone and opening the app again— but nothing works. Haven’t been able to edit for a while now and decided to write this review."
5,im2pretty,THIS APP IS AMAZING LIKE OMG.. but i have a question! Can you guys please add the ghost affect. The same one they have on video star. Iam trying to make an edit and i really need that affect. Oh and add more transitions and more keyframes! Other than that the app is amazing. I havent had any trouble with it
4,Addison_Rae,"It’s a great app to edit with, over all I would suggest for anyone to use it! I would though suggest that it would be made a bit easier, when I’m editing my videos all the buttons are scattered out so it’s a bit hard to find. I love the app overall! 💕"
3,What did he sayyy,I think this app is perfect for beginner editors like my self but I encountered some problems while editing like every time I try to export a video and it almost gets there it says a problem occured and I didn’t do anything and I have tried everything to fix this problem that is the only complaint I have
1,iiMochi_le_smoll_bean,"I am giving it a low rating. Honestly, so basically I was in the middle of editing and it froze. I was upset, as usual, so I existed out of the app. And the I opened the app and tried to enter the edit I was doing. It said insufficient storage, so I checked my storage. It said I had barley used any storage. So I deleted the videos. Still said I didn’t have enough storage, so I deleted the app. I wish I was joking.  Idk if it’s a bug. But fix it pls. Overall it’s a OK app but sometimes confusing."
5,PrincessDekuXD,So I Was Watching Gacha Movies In 2018 i Think And At The Ending It Says CapCut So I Decided Lemme Try Dis App! And It was really easy to use i was gonna make a channel but i wanna do it in the future And i rate this 10/10 Bc It Made My Dream Come True And I Honestly Think You Should Download It 🙂
1,Poggersornot2,"I just downloaded this game and edited a few videos, I really enjoyed the app until I tried to use the features and it said I wasn’t connected to the internet, which is weird because my internet was working just fine. I restarted the app(didn’t work) I deleted the app and reinstalled it (didn’t work) and it’s still not working. I don’t know if this is happening to others but this error is really ruining the app for me."
5,.........hi...........,The fact that everything is free in this app and no ads I recommend the app most editing apps have a lot of ads and you need to pay for most of the app I have nearly had this app for 1 year it’s such a great app
5,Madoomanickbu,I love this mobile editing software because it 1 has no watermark 2 the ending is optional and 3 it doesn’t force you to pay to do certain things. I love this app and will continue to use it for a long time. Thank you.
4,👍🏻Emma👍🏻,"i really love this app, it’s easy to use and it’s great for beginner editors or for people that don’t have the money to buy the expensive editing apps, but i just have one question. is there a way that you can make it to where camera focus 2 fades quicker? it still lasts a long time when i put the speed up to 100 and doesn’t fade as quickly as i’d like it to. i’d just like it if it could fade really fast, if not it’s fine, i just won’t use the blur anymore, but i’d really like it if the camera focus 2 faded faster, thanks!"
5,Darlene sanchez weirdo,Capcut is a really good app it’s free and easy to use.I’ve been getting used to some glitches lol.I recommend this app very much and I also post my edits I do here and a lot of people like the edits and ask me whats the app.I love this app 100% recommend ❤️❤️
5,Brazen62,"Honestly I’ve been through tons of editing apps and all of them have a catch, are bad, glitchy, annoying but not this one. This one is all you’ll ever need and it is super reliable. They deserve 5 stars."
5,😡😫,"I am genuinely surprised this app doesn’t cost any money. All the tools on here make my videos look so professional! It’s very easy to use, and I would recommend this app for beginners. Don’t waste your time downloading iMovie, splice, videoleap, or pocket video. Get this app right here.... ahaha.. now.."
5,kryomii,"I was a CapCut editor for about 3 months now. It helped me develop over time, even though I’m an after effects editor now, I still continue to use this editing app!"
5,the best app for dj's.,I have no idea why I cannot use speed curve I looked everywhere I could and no one seemed to have this problem I am unsure of how this is happening and why but I need some advice on what to do.
5,elliebean22222,"I love the app but can you add auto velocity again one day I tried to do an edit but I couldn’t find the auto velocity, please add it back Because now it’s really annoying to make all of the beats and stuff"
5,fi0shi,"Yo I got a question, did you guys delete the style button when you click on the photo/video because I was editing a video and I couldn’t find the style button—"
5,Zleete,"This probably isn’t it’s intended purpose as an app, but it really does help you make gameplay montages.  I just made one and it looks great! Just a little more practice and they’d look even better."
5,Grievlocke,I love the app I make so much roblox edits but could you add a mirror affect other then that I love the app I can make so much roblox edits and the edits are so cool and it’s so easy to make the roblox edits on this app it’s not so long like the other apps I honestly love this all it’s amazing!!
4,You wanna go with your dad,"I love CapCut it’s a very good app and everything was running smoothly until it kept saying my internet wasn’t connected and i knew my internet was connected and it just made me angry, so if you could please fix this? Thanks"
5,glitterbannanas,As a beginner editor I find it just easy to work with. Honestly Capcut is the best editing app. I’ve tried so many other…this one was the BEST!! I recommend this for anyone who likes making edits for social media or for fun!! Ty Capcut. (Hope this helps)
5,honny bobo,"This is honestly an amazing app, it has so many features! But I have a few suggestions! So for the effect transitions maybe add a cloud one! And for the animations, you can like do effects for it! Overall, it’s amazing I love everything!"
5,Lincoln_Ldub,"Let’s you edit with no watermark! You don’t even need a premium! No ads, and there is a video clip at end that say CapCut, but you can even remove that for free! My favorite editing app and maybe app in general on my phone. 🥰"
5,notgonnaputanickname,"This app is…great! I love to make edits on here and show my family! Although my 4th edit ALMOST became a abomination! Nothing wrong with it though! I  recommend this app if you are a Gacha-tuber, they would get tons and tons of good comments I bet!"
5,vvashhx,"this app is so good, i cant explain how amazing it is. it provides many transitions to use for edits and they all make the edits pop out. this app is also perfect for beginners. if they are starting to edit, i recommend this app for them."
5,lindseygomezz,"love this app at first i didnt know what to do but i  found out some ideas and got better and better this app literally saved my life you can do keyframes for edits on here do any kinds of transitions and flickers , watermarks, basically anything"
3,dhehshfhjfjds,"So, When I started capcut I thought it was incredible. I thought “Wow, This is a good app!” But now , I think its a bit annoying. Whenever I have storage or free up, It still gives me a nofication of “Free up storage” Or something like that. And to today. Its fr*cking irritating, It restarted everything! I was also making a edit. This isnt bad, But it aint good for sure."
1,htimsc01,"This app initially appears very useable, but has a number of issues regarding using with the iPhone.  Don’t download this and then make a video and try to download it.  It won’t:  Download into iMovie.    Download into iCloud (if you have an account)  It appears to download, but if you go to find it under the name you gave your video, or the numerical strings CapCut gives it, it can’t be found.    Apple will not help as it is a third-party application even though it is apparently trying to download into their (latest) iOS.   They say it is something about the application (bad coding?) that is the problem.    If this can be fixed I am happy to re-review the product.  Meanwhile beware if you are using an iPhone."
5,Crystina 💗,I love this app it’s free and awesome for new editors. overlays are the best and cropping videos. You might have some trouble with lagging but just refresh and it should be fine. Also this app is free with no watermark/ you can delete it for FREE. quick edits and long work awesome!
4,Unknown Arthur,Hello! So this is gonna be really short I think this app is overall good but when it comes now to removing a background From a overlay image and video it cuts out things I don’t want cut out and I can’t fix/restore the things I want in said video or image..
1,s terrible app,"I rated CapCut 1 star because you cannot Mel the transitions yourself unlike Alight Motion, if you are a beginner at editing and you want fro try an app to make smoother edits I recommend every other editing apps because of that reason, there are no graphs to make it smoother, the key frames are weird to use, and the transitions are mid. I have been editing for 3 years so I recommend that you take my advice and use other apps but not this one."
2,Zaw MyoHtet,Ok I saw my sis make a vid and it turn out well but wan I do it it turn out very bad for me bc I have a yt channel and I make gaming vids and when I got finished play my game and pressing the app and it said that I can not make a vids out of my photo vids like it is soo bad I fell I wast my time make a vid for my yt channel like it took like 20 or 25 minutes to make it it was a wast of time for me plz fix this I beg you
4,Daviaaa o,The app over all works perfectly fine but on my iphone when i had the app it would make my phone crash and over heat and power off like all the time that’s my only issue other than that i totally recommend!!
4,J e n n y 😎,"First of all I love the app so much, and it can be used for fan edits, velocities, and Roblox edits, etc. However I don’t like how you can’t do your in transitions and only have presets. I would love if you guys would let people make their own transitions and add graphs. Thank you."
5,ronbloxksbetterthanyou,This app is amazing! It is very simple to use and is great for beginners as well! I see nothing wrong with this app! I hope you guys also get to enjoy this app as much as I do! It’s like every single other editing app I use it’s very hard.
4,3dpony,"CapCut is an amazing app, good quality and makes my editing so much easier. But, for some reason the app for me keeps freezing up. I tried restarting but it doesn’t seem to work. Can this problem be fixed?"
5,sugmaCd420,Very good editing app but I’m having this issue when none of my photos are appearing and even after I close the app multiple times it sill does not appear. This happens everywhere I go
4,cancel.ok.idk,"well i think this is a AMAZING app,the only way i can get moving clips is gifs,and it just makes gifs stickers,so i can’t figure out another way to get moving clips,It’s a REALLY great app though(if you cannot change it to where it lets gifs work that’s fine though)"
4,jaydens :),"I am always using cap cut very cool app, I hate when u want to make a video it says I need to clean up phone storage they are my photos and memories why would I have to erase photos , you should really change that because it getting annoying"
4,BB is cool,I would totally recommend it easy and free it’s just like video star editing but free and way easier! But recently I’ve been trying to edit but it says “insufficient storage” I’ve deleted so much even the other edits! I’m not sure what to do please tell me how to fix this please.
5,goodboy2009332,This app is so good every editing app that I get you don’t get everything because you have to buy it but this app all of it’s free and there’s a lot of options for everything
5,DevAtore,I am astonished. This app has no in-app purchases nor ads! I am speechless. I have no complaints. This app has gotten my 5 star. I wish for CapCut to develop even further because this is the app that I ever wish for. Thank you for making this app exist!
4,fr0g gam3r,This app this the best free video editing software you can get. But I think it could use one thing. A subtitles feature. After you record your video it would make subtitles if you said anything. This would save a lot of work.
4,YourFavoriteStarWarsFan,"I love this app, I enjoy all the features and the complete joy it gives while I edit my videos, however, it has come to my attention that the “styles” button no longer appears, whats up with that?"
5,266363727,The app is definitely the BEST editing app I have ever used the only problem is that for some reason it’s not letting me use new effects because it says that I’m not connected to the internet even though I am.
3,xwolfy_brookex,"I have to say, it’s very easy to use! But, sometimes it says ‘insufficient storage. Please free up some phone storage and try again’ and I have enough storage, it’s a bit annoying at times. I’ve deleted and reinstalled the app many times because of this, I hope it gets fixed, but besides that it’s good to use! <3"
5,Tony from ls ls rekordz,This app has literally what many other other been trying all these years. Seriously after this app u not longer need to use any other app to edit videos. #Amazing
3,LYRICCCCCCCCCCC,Hey so I’ve been using capcut for a while and I really like it. But the thing is after I spend time making a edit I save it and it always goes off beat. Which is really annoying because I spend time on my edits. So yea I don’t know if it’s only me or if it’s my phone but I just hope that gets fixed.
3,Lesle The Pretzel,"I was making a bfb edit cause why not and right when I needed Velocity BOOM gone, goner than the money I got on my birthday taken by my mom I was so mad and kinda still is PLEASE bring back the style button so people who need velocity don’t have to freaking die during the process of making velocity"
4,thabuddy2009,"When I was going to make an edit for my friend I use style but this day it was not there,so I was confused so I updated the app and still nothing,does any one know how to fix this or did CapCut take away the effect?"
4,BackPack-Kid,"I like CapCut, it’s a good editing app and explains it pretty well for newer people, the problem is that none of the updates are there, like the auto velocity thing, no matter what I do it’s never there, I really hope they fix it"
4,ZerotwosWaifu,Capcut is a good app to edit I use it very often but when I wanted to make a Velocity edit it wouldn’t show the option in styles? I thought it was because I didn’t update the app but when I went to check it just said “OPEN” so am really confused.
2,jsnshaudhjhs,I always loved capcut and never had an issue with it until recently. Like every time i try to zoom in a clip it never goes to the part where i wanna zoom in and now the audio is messed up when I do overlays. The audio never matches the beat and starts at a later time and i’ve redownloaded the app just for it to be the same… Fix this?
5,Dude1536845,"Hey! This app is awesome for beginners and advanced editors! I started with capcut and i still use it to this day! First of all here are some reasons why i love capcut! The stickers are ADORABLE, awesome text animations, keyframes to animate, masking, and i absolutely LOVE the animations! I love this app, you should try it out! (Best for beginners) <33"
4,QTluci_fer,"Amazing app, very easy to use to make edits when im bored! The new slow-mo is really amazing. I just recommend that the app should add in 'HSL' coloring along w/ 'Selective HSL' which would be better for certain edits instead of the 'color negative, ec.' effects. I also recommend the app adds 3d things <3"
4,bghrhbsjshfbehdg,CapCut is a good editing app for beginners but when I updated it it was not working it says when I press “new project” “CapCut needs access to photos” when I look at settings I don’t see photos. I downloaded it again and it still is not working!
5,mintxrain,Capcut includes so many incredible features without any cost at all! The app makes it so easy to make your videos look amazing. I would definitely recommend using this app.
3,Aria_girds,So I started making very good edits but one day I went to edit a video and it said all my videos were deleted. I was devastated I didn’t know what to do I started to cry all my hard work was gone. And I deleted the app. So now I’m gonna try again. But if this happens ever again. I’d make a complain.
5,alsnicolon,Hi CapCut owners I would like to say that this app is amazing app so many things you can make with CapCut but i also wanted you guys or girls to know that I did not get the new update that you guys or girls had just put in a couple days ago
4,Mia Jane Perkins,"Hi! I love your app so much but the thing that makes me super mad is when I try to do transitions and it say no WiFi when I have full bars of WiFi. And it says it every time I try to use transitions so if you could find a way to fix that, it would be amazing!   I love your app 😁"
4,Marly152552,"It’s really great and all I learned new hacks, there’s good effects transitions, etc. but my only problem is that whenever I try speeding my video up, it likes to do its own thing and choose the speed up for me, if you can fix that I’ll gladly appreciate it!!"
5,Idunno person,This is the best app for editing I was a rookie but now I know how to edit more and better capcut is the best for beginners capcut is a good app compared to some other apps I downloaded I didn’t know how to work them but capcut makes it so easy to edit!
4,Fw.Torch,"I love capcut and its easy to learn unlike alight or anything else. but the thing abt alight is they have more effects, they have graphs, and smooth slow-mo. Also much more. Im sure alot of ppl would use capcut more if u added stuff alight has but capcut is still a great app either way"
4,7438274983268&13,First of all this app is fantastic and great for beginners. Has an awesome and simple UI and easy to learn. And its 100% free. Happy to keep using this app but it needs some improvements and additions:   1- When slowing clips we need a smooth version bc it becomes very choppy and not usable 2- it would be nice to have motion blur for effects 3- lastly to help improve or keep video quality bc sometimes it turns out worse than when you imported it in  Otherwise I love this app and suggest it to any one who wants to start editing or not wanting to buy and editing app!
3,Evilyn18,"this is a great app for starter editors but I do have a couple things. One, i would love to have a thing we’re we could add our own fonts. i’ve seen people with androids do it but not apple users like me. Two, the slow-mo is not that great. I use VSCO for my slow motion but still if we could have good slow-mo it would cut a lot of time."
5,🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🥳,I was wondering if it were possible to make animations for the effects. I thought it would’ve been pretty cool to make the effects fade in or blur in or just other animations in generally
4,sarok015,so this app is a good editing app like u can take away the watermark for free unlike other editing apps. but there is a bug where like the storage I DELETED ALL MY PICS MY VIDA AND STILL I DELETED 1 OF MY FAV APPS BUT STILL I HAVE LIKE 6 APPS AND 1 VIDEO NOW WHAT? u guys need to fix this. it is absolutely annoying. but still it is a good app. sorry for the short review.
5,lillith age:8,"This is the best ever you can do cool, effects without having to pay money for a small change to the video this is the best app I’ve seen I defenitly recommend it dosent have any bugs and I just love it"
5,Enayat Hamrah,"It is the best app We want you add the person language because in Afghanistan , Iran and Arabia people are used   Accept our request  We waiting the next update to include the person language"
4,cutiegacha😩👺😠🧡,"Hey! So I use this app ALOT and I have some recommendations so can you add like anime videos and velocity and slow then fast and I really want to edit an anime and it’s gonna be hard to record because I’m bad at timing so please I’ve want this since I got this app! Please add and thank you very much,❤️"
5,TITLISR,"Dear, CapCut   Your app is Fantastic! And there’s so many effects and sounds.  Please add more effects and sounds.  My parents were amazed by this software, and I recommend all YouTuber’s to get the app. This app is perfect. Thank you for reading, have a nice day or night! Bye! 👋"
5,lazyoreo,Thanks for making this I been trying to find a good app for editing/making videos but all the others needed money and I didn't understand😔 Anyways Thank youuu😭 lol
4,colbys_koalabear,"I love this app so much! But it needs like similar effects and transitions if they look at vs it would make everyone think that it’s a really good app, plus they should add some watermarks from alight motion it would be cool to have some of those there 😂 best app though 😌"
5,Phin Wolfe,I love this app and all of its features. It’s got everything I need and is easy to use. I wish I could get a version for my laptop so I could use it for my bigger protects
1,Kam🖤,"This app was amazing for the first month I used it. But then it started saying that I didn’t have enough storage to make videos, but I have a lot of storage on my phone. And it won’t let me upload certain pictures because “my internet connection is bad” even though my internet is fine. I used this app almost everyday and I used it to edit all of my videos but it doesn’t work any more:( I am very disappointed"
5,AmoghOnGaming,"I edit a lot on mobile. I used Videoleap premium btw. But comparing that to this app, I’d say Capcut is way better in numerous way. Plus this app is FREE. There are so many effects to choose from, I’m just surprised that a free editing app like this can compete with PAID EDITORS. 5 STARS!"
5,pandaissocute,okay so I am a editor and I use video star but now I have seen capcut this app underrated!! like seriously for real this app great for beginners😊❤️ this helps them become an amazing pro editor ( ps idk why people using the fake editing app vinkle it steals edits! ) so yeah capcut is the best app ever for beginners😁❤️❤️❤️
5,uezhdhhfbxeukf,I love everything on this app it has no watermarks and everything thing is free and it is hard to find apps that have NO watermarks and it dose not take up my storage but this app is a 10/10 for me and it is easy on the go!
4,momiebug6,"I’ve been using this app for a while🙂 and now it doesn’t let me type anything or do anything except animate the videos😬 it really makes me mad :/ , but other than that your app is really great and I hope you can fix it☺️ !"
3,Chantalle!🤒,It’s a nice edit app the only problem is that whenever I add a new photo to my gallery that I want for my edit it doesn’t show in the app. It’s really annoying and I’ve tried deleting it and installing it again but it still didn’t show up. Other then that it’s good so I rate it 3 stars for that problem.
4,Samantha.santacruz,The app seems to be freezing usually around the 6 minute or longer time and it happens most often. If you could just maybe update the app that Would be wonderful. Other than that everything is amazing.
5,Addison40,It is amazing it’s completely free no watermark. I love it get it. It did take me a little bit to figure out how to get the editing and all the features that it offers. Once you get it down it’s amazing Best editing app I’ve ever downloaded.
4,cement_eat3r,"When i found out they removed 3d zoom i uninstalled capcut and used a vpn to see if it would connect to a country that still has it. i lost all my projects. all that hard work. all those amazing montages, gone in the blink of an eye."
5,GogurtMogurt,Capcut is amazing I love that everything is free unlike other video editing apps. There are so many premade effects to choose from and so many more things! I recommend capcut for sure!
4,Aviators_YT,"Recently, the style effect has gone missing. I have been very disappointed with it because I like making edits with 3d zoom and more of those effects. If they bring it back, I will change my review to 5 stars."
4,melody٩(๑❛ᴗ❛๑)۶,"capcut is a really great editing app! I use it every day! However, i hate that, on iPad, whenever i try to use camera and flip it to make it face my face, it doesn’t flip. It just uses the back camera, not the front. Please please please PLEASE fix this!! It’s really getting on my nerves!!"
4,Charlovescats!🐱✨,"So, I love capcut but I have a little suggestion… can u put squiggly borders around the edits people try to make? You maybe could put it into the ‘effects’ section! :-) That would be so nice! That’s all from me please read this! :-)🐱"
5,bdhshsjhd,"I love this app but can you make tweening easier, also you should put graphs when you move your thing the format should have additional stuff"
5,selena_Kh_,"Usually when I do updates nothing happens like the new velocity thing I don’t have it, for the style I only have the 3 normal ones. If this is a bug pls try to fix it."
4,Indi 👀,I’ve been using CapCut since late 2020 so I have a lot of experience but the feature that lets you use a tiktok audio doesn’t work it always says I’m offline THATS my main issue and if I use more then 3 effects it gets really laggy
5,chillpaw45,I highly recommend this app to new editors it’s very simple and easy but still has a lot of options to choose from for editing. Plus you can remove the watermark!
5,Rorita dear,I like capcut it helps us with editing and it’s getting better and better and I like the new slow mo update I really like the updates so you should download this app I think it’s great in my opinion!
5,Tiktokisstuppid,"When I joined the CapCut community I was so lost on how people were doing velocities,and the best edits just by using CapCut. CapCut is so good it has smooth slow mo,animations,velocity,good quality(overlays),and so easy to use! I hope all of you guys enjoy CapCut."
4,Jack Ladds,"Whenever I change my internet connection while the app is open, when I try to look at my sound from tiktok it’s says I have no internet connection and cannot access them."
4,43323233232,"So first of all I really like this app, it help me with school, videos, and many others things but I thinks that they should give more music options like we can search or give us music that give us suggestions"
5,add a age thing,I LOVEEEEEE THIS APPP!! Ive been using it for 2 years I've been improving on my editing skill and stuff but I would love for this app to have effect skills like the blur effect fading in and out it would help me with a lot of editing videos for tiktok and stuff :>!!
5,cocksucca,"One of the best phone editing apps seen, from the multiple choices of animations and being able to import custom fonts is amazing, still more places to improve but it’s amazing for being free"
5,ZTH13,"When making velocity’s and wanting to slow clips down, they always end up really laggy. Do you think you could add something that allows it to “smoothen” kind of like vsco? thanks!"
5,ndhdhdbsjsndhjddbusndhd,okay i love the app i had it sense 2years i been on it i love it so much but it says something and i go on ur capcut thing and u can’t find won that’s off that will fix the problem pls help with this and i need better quality on my roblox edits i love the app dj much tho it’s my second fav pls do what i asked or i will never be able to edit on this it won’t go away 😢😭😭😭😭🥺pls help wit this promise creators i luv u for making the app ;);( but it won’t go away it started a day ago
4,MidSherlockedStation,"As the title says, this has got to be the best video editor out there and it's all free! But I wish features such as uploading your music (from say files) and iCloud saving/syncing across devices were here. Please consider adding these features!"
4,hi. jsbsbdne,It’s a great app and has a lot of potential but theres not that much transitions and they’re really basic and it would be great if the slow motion wasn’t so bad maybe smooth it out and add more transitions that aren’t terrible and it would be amazing.
3,pitchplease16,"i love this app and i make a lot of edits with it but at one point it said i had no more room to make any more i had to delete all of my edits and it still wouldnt work then i deleted over 10,000 photos and videos and it STILL didnt work so if you could fix this it would be amazing to amoe more edits again"
5,gamm312,It’s the best app for editing I’ve ever seen you can do different tricks on them you can edit different ways you can do what you want to edit you can grab video you can grab photos it’s the best app  I seen
5,jr123018,Hey CapCut workers !!! You did amazing with this app. But it’s hard for me to do velocity and the slow motion so can you guys add smooth slow motion cause I use a app and it cost just for the slow motion so if you guys see this please do this for the next up!! Love the app ❤️
4,?..OOF..?,Okay so I started using this app before it got popular but i've started noticing when I add effects it gets super laggy and I cant see what the results are. The audio glitches and then the video stops for a few seconds and starts again?
5,coraandlexiesdad,I love the app I’m really good at making edits on it but one complaint is that when I slow my videos instead of slowing it basically makes it laggy can you fix that??
5,BEST APP TO TALK WITH FREINDS,So when I’m bored I feel like editing something but of course it takes to long and hard without this app this app is amazing! I also I love with my edits so much now and it’s let’s your mind free and the finishing touch is the best
5,skjmfjdlsk,"This app is amazing! It’s easy to use, and I got this app as a beginner with 0 problems. It runs very smoothly on my iPad, but it lags on my phone. The app itself is amazing, and feature-packed. 10/10 recommend!"
3,unirainbowpoops,"I love the CapCut app but I have one problem it keeps asking me to confirm when I try to post and I don’t know how to confirm and I can’t find any videos about it, I was like, oh it probably needs some updating but it’s not letting me update it and I have a TikTok and people are still waiting for my video to post someone please help me"
4,love roblox <3,I love all about except I only done two edits and it already told me that I don’t have enough storage even though I have 15 pictures and barely any apps it keeps doing that to me every time that gets to a point I have zero pictures left so That’s alll
3,dracos mommy,"I love this app. It’s really good for beginners in editing and it also is very easy to make edits with. But I can’t use it anymore because it says my storage is full. So now I’m using video star but it’s to hard to use so I can’t edit right now. :(  If Capcut is reading this, please update your app to let people actually edit."
5,horben_flew,This app is great but for some reason whenever I try to upload a video it keeps saying “insufficient storage” and it keeps happing I hope CapCut fixes that but other than that this app is a 10/10!
4,A mistake but love it.,So I love this game it works so good but the problem is I cant take videos back like revive them I accidentally deleted my video I spent 2 hours editing and I don't know how to revive it. Its been 30 minutes and I'm still crying can you please fix this.
3,Ak@r!,"I was going to edit a video but I realized that I couldn’t make it longer so I would have to keep adding the same video over and over again. Is that a new update? Because that “feature” makes it very hard to edit. Other than that, this app is very is a very useful edit app!"
5,ItCoolEmily,"This app is for beginners who likes to edit. This is a baby step. You pretty learn how to edit and do basic things. After that,You go to Video star. But you have to pay in order to use Video Star. Capcut is a pretty good app."
5,Bella yuqing Huang,"Five stars. My edits are trash before and noe its amazing! Thanks to thid app i got 6k follows🙃 but you should add a button thats the same like filters, “add to all” because i get annoyed of putting the same effect. Bye hope you read this and download it😗"
5,Tacoplays1234,"A few months ago I have seen CapCut in a tutorial, I just thought it was a normal editing app, nothing special. BUT ITS NOT! I have made like intros for people on my channel! People LOVE IT! I love the effects so so so so so so so so so so so SOOOO MUCH! My favorite is the butterflies they look so real! -Love, Taco."
5,🎍ɳαƚαʅιҽ🎋,This app is really good to edit I don’t know why people be hating on this app. This app Gives you no watermark and all the effects are 💯% Free I love this app so I give it 5 Starts I edit so much in this application Thank you for making this application! 👍
5,every nockname is taken omg,"the effects are so easy and makes me feel like a real editor without any effort, I will be using it for the rest of my life! I also love how we can remove the watermark/ending for free, way better than any other app- get this."
5,ichbjtd,It’s really perfect I like the app it has no watermark and it’s hundred percent free it’s better than any Free editing apps I ever use but I would suggest some stuff like like if we can add our own transitions or create them I think that will be very cool
5,😅😆Mari😎🎃,"Oh my god, first off this app MY GOD, all is free!! Which I had just got this app and I was like, I need to rate this... so far no bugs- at the end though is has the CapCut logo, but that dose not really matter- this has SOO MUCH to offer. You should definitely try this out 🤗🤗"
4,Marina 😍,This app is great I use to make tiktok edits almost every other day. But I do find myself having to switch apps because the transitions are very fast and I wish I could slow them down a little bit. But aside from that this app is amazing!!
5,minhology,"So, I just want to say that I am overall... SHOCKED!!! I have NEVER in my life came across an app like this! It has to be the app of 2021. I heard this app on many Gacha Life videos and edits, and I thought “why not give it a shot?” So I did, and it is incredible. Great work!"
4,Sassy Girl Sierra,So the app is great I well be using it a lot more but the bling effect is not working like it’s says “no Internet connection” but I’m connected to Internet even when I shut my internet on and off it won’t work and reboot my phone it won’t work but over all I like the app.
5,fluffy_shakes,I love this app so much because for one it doesn’t make u pay for good editing tools like other apps out there and it’s really good and easy to use so I definitely recommend this app to people looking to edit
5,Starlighttt😝,This is probably one of the best editing apps I’ve ever tried. I’m a small TikToker and this helps so much! It’s compatible for all devices for FREE! I have no words for how many hours of editing this has saved me. It’s so simple yet very detailed.
5,TeamGilmore,"This is a very short review but I have barely started CapCut and it’s an amazing app!! So so easy to use and really understanding and fun to use!! I also love how I can  extract the sound form any video and use it, that really really helps!! :)"
5,hdhfhfhfhrjfnfj,I’ve never seen such a good transitions and editing app I love this app and it took a while to find a good editing app because this one is so underrated but it is such a good app perfect! I will definitely suggest this app to family and friends!
5,King-0f-B@sketBaII,"I’m a editor for Fortnite montages and Jesus, this app has surprised me very much. You can do so much with such a free app! I would suggest deleting Kinemaster or Videoleap, because the stuff you need is HERE! Probably the best Mobile editing software so far for editors like me."
4,samdnd,I like this app because it does really good edits and I like the things u can do to edit a video. But my problem is that while I’m editing some of the effects don’t let me work idk why which is weird cuz it used to let me use all the effects and now ur doesn’t.😭😔
4,DA BEST!!!!!!!!,"so, I started using CapCut when they were not adding any news effects. When they added the velocity, I was never able to use it. I re-downloaded CapCut and I updated it to. So idk whats wrong with it but pleaded fix this!"
1,fake app 1,1 star for now I wish I can put no stars This app deserves no stars because I am unable to add imports from my phone to edit it let me for 10 minutes and now I can’t do anything plz fix this problem plz I star for now but I will be uninstalling the app and you will be given no stars for the actions of this horrible app can’t Evan add what I want to edit that a shame no stars goodbye
5,boston.t.g.1,"This app is phenomenal honestly one of the best you can get for free, although there is no audio equaliser or landscape orientation implementation. if these features and more such as, mouse and keyboard compatibility i would make a one time purchase with no hesitation."
5,Heycici,This app is free and make the best edits but can y’all please add more effects and tools😢I thinks your better than viedostar I use this app every day I’m obsessed thank you for making this app and add effects and animations like video star btw Best app in the world💜
5,cslang13,"I’ve bought like 5 apps to edit which I regret because it’s been months and I still can’t figure out how to use them even with watching vids but this app? It’s the sugar honey ice tea it comes with a bunch of cool transitions, effects etc. and ITS FREE"
5,malaky beas,The stuff you can do on this app is insane I’ve done edit that I would not be able to do on my other editing app but the only bad thing is my phone isn’t powerful enough for it to run smoothly (but that’s on me) AN AMAZING APP I LOVE IT
5,Harper McK,"I mainly use capcut for tiktoks, but there is so many cool effects, fonts, stickers and more! You can even add fonts and add multiple videos!! There are amazing transition hacks and LOTS of absolutely AMAZING different effects and filters! Download it and join the amazing fun!! ❤️"
5,maggiehfinvgi,I love CapCut I have been using it for awhile to make edits on tiktok I have over 6k followers with a velocity only acct but now that they took auto velocity off I can’t do any edits and I’m losing followers I just wish they brought it back
4,slime22458,Before this update I could make videos and adjust the exposure and sharpen it and it would look amazing now after this recent update when I try to do it after I export it make my video laggy please fix it
5,schleich lover 200,"Hi, so my CapCut animations and affects aren’t working and I’ve updated the app and it’s still not working so I’m wondering if you guys can fix it I make intros and I can’t make any without CapCut :/  Amazing app though!!! <3"
5,Meow meow moe,it’s really good but there is one thing when I type it sometimes disappears and when I close it doesn’t go away if you can fix it I will be happy thank you!
4,EditsOfArcadia,"I have been using this app for 2 years and love it! The only problem is that the slo-mos are not smooth. It would be nice if there was somehow a smooth option when making the speeds of a video. But other than that, very impressed."
3,uni😙👓🍉,This app is really good it helps me edit but every single time I do something a glitches let me tell you the first things I hate (1: whenever I click on the effect it says try again later (2: my thing keeps glitching (3: every single time I try to make a edit it says my storage is full
5,this_annoying_ girl gigi77,I love this app in my opinion I feel like it’s better than any other editing app and it’s necessary not to like it here and there but other than that I 100% recommend this app!
5,crazyy 😝😝😝😝,So CapCut is a good app overall with the editing and stuff like that but I recommend for the camera part to make filters an better yk so not being mean I just giving a suggestion 👍

4,hatake wifey,It’s good but ever since then I upload my videos or edits it’s always laggy and idk why I’m just having a hard time because when I play it in the app it’s not laggy but when I finish it and upload it all together it’s laggy and more slower😭
5,💞UwU review princess UwU💞,"So good ! But I have some suggestions. First of all, try adding some graphs because it would make the effects so much better! Second I think you should add some shakes and colorings."
5,I love Minecraft1234567891011,So I was going to create a Roblox edit with KineMaster but I decided not to kineMaster because it’s kind of hard ;-; so I decided to download this and then try to do Roblox edit and it worked :D I recommend you download this because it’s very fun to use :)
4,hyrio_zephen,Idk what is happening but I love this app but… it keeps randomly flashing pink and it was stressful but I hope the people at CapCut can fix this problem. Maybe it’s because I have too much in my edits or what but I just want them to fix this!
4,camilav3017,"“Insufficient storage clean up some photos & try again “ I only have 200 photos please try fixing that if not idk it’s probably my phone such a great app to edit, & find audios thank you very much if you fix it or not !"

5,it_kk12345678919,Hi! This app is just amazing! I’d love to thank you for making everything free! It’s makes me so happy! I normally never give editing apps 5 stars. But this one just amazed the crap out of me! It’s FREE! Like- no editing all that I have used is free-
5,Astro_Jasmine,I have been using this for over a month and it is good but I wish they can add something to where you can download a font on to the app so you can use it but overall it is good
5,gfshim,"I love this app because it’s free getting it, and using it. The music is good and if you get to understand the game, you surely will enjoy it. For example I made a montage and shared it with my family and they loved it. Thank You CapCut"

4,cookie wolf1365,"i really like this app and i've been using it for a couple of months now for my edits and it's really easy and fun!! but maybe u can add a feature like graphs for the speed of a transition and an animation if u have time? if not that's totally fine don't worry! i just want to be able to change the timing of the speed of the transitions without having to change the speed of the video, too. there could possibly be a curve option for transitions and animations or a speed of them? thanks and have a great day!! 😊"
5,Liz_BeHonesy,"CapCut is 100% free and everyone on it is free no paying for anything, but if you’re storage is full it doesn’t let you make a video but overall it’s an amazing app, I would definitely recommend it"
3,cece is disappointed,I love capcut but every time I tried to get into the at my storage is full and I have to delete so much stuff just to edit please remove that if my storage is full it’s still let me edit in my storage is not full capcut is taking up all my storage that’s why it’s full and that’s just not right with me
3,smjskskjs,So I like the game but every time I make something it keeps moving cus I’m trying to make a thing called tween edit and I need different body parts and when I put one down it keep moving and the whole thing starts glitching and I need that to be fixed please cus it keeps glitching and starts moving the thing I need
5,WyGuy119,Although this is a video editor it doesn’t work very well with videos over 5 minutes but that doesn’t matter I use it for anime edits it’s free so it’s not gonna be like after effects but hey it’s still great!
4,heyitsxella,I would give this a 5/5 if they still had the auto velocity feature..I don’t know if it’s just me but they removed this..otherwise very user friendly and I would get it back if they add it back
1,KristinaVidz,Idk if I’m the only one having this problem but it says insufficient storage and I tried deleting the app and redownloading it but it wouldn’t even let me make 1 video so I deleted it again and didn’t even let me download it back. I thought my storage was full but it says 199.7 GB out of 2 TB used so it’s definitely not full. I deleted 457 photos and 91 videos but it still didn’t work. I don’t know what’s going on
5,igugfhchdhdhdgssdfx,Don’t get me wrong I LOVE this app it’s free you don’t need to buy anything plus it has no water mark but it would be MUCH better if there were some newer transitions and effects that’s all.
5,hassank62,"Being one of those people who barely ever write reviews, this had to impress me a whole lot. I’ve been looking for a decent app to make short edits on my phone and boy did I hit the jackpot. Its amazing on all ends. Thumbs for the devs, you are the GOATs."
5,vexvexlng,I’ve been using the app for months and now I can’t even edit my videos are gone and the overlays aren’t working and can y’all please add more because the apps amazing I love it and I need to edit more so please fix
5,abrinkm54,"When I download this app I was a bit skeptical because I saw it as a Snapchat add, and normally they are not very good apps with a lot of adds. This was not the case for this app. This app has helped me so much and is so easy to use."
5,Sugathesufa,I never thought i would right a review on any app ever but please bring the style button back soon!!! Alot of people including myself are upset about this 😭
4,Mike5552314338282,This is an amazing editing app I would’ve given it a 5 star but there’s a bug that I don’t like basically when I first open the app and o want to add a picture there all gone so I have to restart the app to get the pictures back
5,FT. P.B,When I first started using it I already knew what to do (thanks to one tutorial I watch) I like to make edit audios with CapCut and demon slayer edits but I had to delete it because I got in trouble 😞 but the new effects are AMAZING 🤩 like literally I love’ em like so much like yeah
3,Yellow-Kun,I usually don’t have problems with this app but every time I make an edit/video it freezes and I don’t like that at all it Ruins it and just messes up my edits I thought it was my storage but it’s really not it the app acting up on me maybe fix that glitch for please but overall the app is great.
4,Astro ^^,"So, I’ve been using this app for a while and I love the animations but there’s only a few we can really use and I would really like to be more animations so I won’t use the same ones, But overall this is good app and would recommend. -Omari"
4,salchinn,I really like it but there is one thing I am concerned about once I was excited to make a video but it would not let me use tictok favorites it keeps saying Connect to the internet then try again when everthing else is working
4,chanbear from youtube,"Lately I he all has been freezing ridiculously way to much, almost every 10 minutes it will freeze and kick me out over and over. Even my audio will cut in  and out and it slows down so much!"
4,Geniiiicorrrnnnn,"I mean the app is a really good app, it has everything you could really need now that there is graphs, but I feel like you guys should fix the custom graphs setting, it’s confusing to use and you can’t really get it to the liking you want"
5,avy popcorn😜,"This is an amazing app for beginners that want to learn how to edit. It has simple tutorials, fun filters and effects, wonderful music, and most amazing part, ITS COMPLETELY FREE. Other editing apps cost too much money for simple things."
5,Hi:) good app,( short review)  Very good app to use to edit it glitches a lot but once you export it it don’t glitch in the edit but while editing it does other than that it’s a good app.
5,humfcg,"Your editing app is astounding! I love it a lot, but maybe you could add some stuff to it? Maybe like a “Shake Out” transition, and you can chance the frequency and amplitude for shakes. Overall, I love your editing app."
5,xAshanti merrily Branford 40,I make edits using cap cut and vsco but capcut does most of the work! I have been using this for 2 years for a beginner it’s bot easy I found out all of this but looking threw all the cap cut stuff and yeah overall it’s a great editing app!!!!❤️
5,✨Yes queen ✨,"✨This is by far the best app I’ve ever used I can’t imagine not having Capcut! They update once a week, They have so many filters, effects and they even have tutorials! This is a great app, I 100 % think you will love this app! <3"
5,SpaceFOX218,"you guys make it so easy to edit and even import images from photos! overall its very good and i have some suggestions (do them if you want)  suggestions 1. add a scale U.I. for image stickers 2. uh.. being able to move text around the screen without using the pre-made animations (2 modes by the way, dragging and animating and also goes for the stickers?) 3. uhh….. ran out of ideas!  best editing app 10/10  anyone who reads this should give it a try!"
4,Kiarra🥶🥵,CapCut is good but there shakes are really stiff and there transitions in general are stiff. They just need better animations is what I’m trying to say when you slow down the video or something like that it becomes glitchy
5,Amee Torbett,I had this app for a few weeks now and everything has been great! Many editing options and tools. Also it’s free! Which I love. 10/10 recommend.
4,Girlwithbigdreames,"I have been using the app for a while and I think it is really cool! However there is one issue. When making an edit, it is on-beat, but as soon as I export it, the edit is off-beat from the song. Is this a glitch? Thanks!"
5,AWillowA13,So CapCut is really nice I’m glad to have I make them and show them to my friends it’s really useful for people with TikTok I think people should use it I mean like CapCut Is a decent game you csn make cool effects and stuff so I think it’s pretty nice
5,a niffer,CapCut is bizarre but I had a bug where I couldn't have a full  voice over! Please fix this but overall 10/10 I would recommend this for sure!
5,High qualitu,"Hello, CapCut this app is a great editing high quality app, I use it for roblox edits and it’s great and I like this editor app so much thank you CapCut for making this app and there’s so many effects my fav effect is the angel in the shadow, I love this edit app so much thank you!

5,ItsAvo_,Amazing app and the fact that it has no watermark makes it so much better! Please never change that. This app has so many good editing features so it’s definitely worth to get.
5,kems dhdksndud du,"This app is AWESOME i have a few requests, I would like for the community to add after effects transitions or/and effects. to be honest, the transitions are a bit choppy and no offense, not smooth. Also i want you to add text effects. THANK YOUU"
5,TACOCAT3819,"Wow! I am super impressed! I am blown away by the hundreds of options you could use on your videos. Everything is free, fast-working, and top-quality. And the best part-you can remove the watermark!!"
4,smallTodoroki,Hello owners of CapCut! I love this app and all but sometimes when I go to make a new edit it’ll tell me I have no photos when I do. I would like to ask if you could add a search feature for the songs and stuff. Also please do add more animations. Thank you and I love your app!
4,flybirdty,"I am a pro editor and I been working with CapCut for over a year now, but when ever I try to zoom in or move it it glitches bad it not working for me. I would recommend it but I need the glitch to fix before I can"
5,glossymil,"Ok first of all. This app is amazing! It is completely free and super easy to use! I personally recommend this app because I use it to edit my tik toks and it works very well, very good quality and no watermarks! So please download CapCut! I promise it’s worth it!"
5,💕Jaediva💕,This is one of the best apps I’ve ever used and I’m actually so surprised. I do say sometimes the video quality is bad but it’s workable and everything else is perfect! I love CapCut! There’s a watermark but you can delete IT! Continue to upgrade it!
5,dark dragon7001,I think this app is the best one that I ever came across and it should be the best app for editing videos I just wish that they can add audio quality because I like making Memes on this app and for that I rate it a five star😄😁
5,Katelyn 👌🏻👌🏻,If you were seen this just download the app it is the best editing app out there I've ever tried saying this just click the get button and get the app it's so good I highly recommend
5,Benjamin Lynch 🏹,"I really recommend this app! Before I used iMovie and then my friends like hold up, you gotta use CapCut! And I am so happy I switched to CapCut. Not only that you can upload it to TikTok. I’ve used half of all my videos using CapCut. Great app!"
5,alison cpolahd,"Out of all the editing apps I have tried, this ones the best! It’s easy to master, and it has really good features. I love the transitions and effects! Sure, there are some problems, but overall I love it!!!"
4,8##))%$,So I was doing edit and the next day I will go about to do another edit but I realize that style wasn’t there so I couldn’t and I just wanted to let you know could you please add that back
4,evbcruz_12345,I just wanted to make a edit but when I went to find style it wasn’t there. Did you guys remove the style thing because seriously why would you guys remove it???? I’m very upset about this right now.
4,~ℝ𝕖𝕖𝕤𝕖~,"It is really good. When I first started it, I HATED IT! Then I was struggling on velocity until you guys added it which was the best. Thank you for adding that… Can we get some more effects and stuff? Like the person becomes black and a red background?? That would be nice!"
5,_.al1ah._,"I love this app! When I first started using this, I was confused, but now I know how to use this app! I have used this for 1-2 years! Amazing app! I hope you can add more effects in the future!"
3,aria assa,"Hello, I updated CapCut to the latest update (version 5.5.0) and I have the iPhone 12 and I was really excited to use the auto velocity feature, but the option is not being presented to me at all. I looked for it everywhere and it’s not on the app. How can I fix this?"
5,hi fghehehehijrhfx,I love capcut ive been using it from when i started editing it got some really good updates i still use it even tho i prefer other apps this is really good keep up the good work capcut!
5,hhuhuhhuhuhu,"I downloaded CapCut because my friend recommended it, and i did not expect it to be so good. I just LOVE this app it’s so simple and fun but still with a lot of great options! Keep on keeping on!"
5,A Person who likes Chickens,"Capcut is an amazing started editor app!! I would definitely recommend and get it if you can!!  (Sorry for the short review 😅 it’s just that those two sentences sum it up, really)"
5,AngryPooHead,"CapCut is a great, easy to learn, feel-good editing app. With over a hundred no-copyrighted songs, to voice filters, and video transitions. I downloaded CapCut about 1 year ago, and I learned everything within 1 month."
5,guysloo,I recently got this app and I am loving it! You can use all the features with needing to buy a monthly payment for the special features. I really appreciate this. Capcut also makes editing so easy and fun to do! 5 stars awesome app!
5,katarina tucker,So I’ve been using this for a least two years now and it is amazing and I love it but you can’t really do a lot of things but over all it’s amazing it has Amazing edits and everything😁
3,hehvdidbdi,"So I started CapCut about a while ago and honestly it’s great but I just think that the transitions needs to be cleaner, and maybe add more transitions. I also think that the slow motion is not that great and it needs to be better. Lastly, I feel like they should add more fonts that are trendy."
4,gabbimynickname1,This app is a very good app i just wish that you wouldn’t need internet to use it I also hope they can add water mark and that they make it easier to do the big glowing lights I don’t know how to explain it 😅 but other than that it’s a great app
5,Lainey Veiga,I really like this app it is really easy for people that just started editing. When I first downloaded it it was very easy to deal with. It has lots of cool filters and effects. I use it every day.
4,DODODOODDOODDO,"this is a really good editing app. though, when my storage gets full it doesn't let me make a video. and i have to delete all my IMPORTANT photos and videos. this app is fun and games for when you have storage but if it’s full, it’s not fun in games."
5,cutie love roblox❤️,"okay soooo I love the app. It’s beyond amazingggg, and I’m so glad that they moved the good animations to the front  lol that’s all I have to say but download this app if ur a starting editor, it’s really easy, and once you get the hang of it, it will turn out so good trust me :))"
4,bibiesther,It says in my photos I have none pls fix that if u do that would be very kind thanks very much and also it would need a bit of improvement there should be a watermark instead of the CapCut outro
4,PolskaCat Gaming,When I try to use a video as music and when I only want to select a small part of said video. Instead of the clip it brings the whole video             Other wise great editing app keep up the great work
5,Dafirehawk,This app is probably the best editing app for FREE!!! It has everything other paid editing apps have and it’s all free there is no premium membership or anything this has to be the greatest app to ever come for editing
5,Grace Wince,"I love this app, I have made so many things with it. I just wanted to give a few suggestions about the app.  1. I would really love if you could make the slomo a lot smoother because when I do the slomo its really glitchy.  2. It would be amazing if you could add more smoother transitions/animations because the animations are amazing! It would just be fantastic if you could add smoother ones, like warping, or better shakes.  Thats all, and thank you for taking your time to read my review :)"
5,mama poop hahahahahahaha,"I love capcut no complaints at all!!! I was wondering if you could add a feature that makes it so you can slow down the translations or the effects, whatever you wanna call it lol 😂 all in all love the app bye!"
4,MoonGamer70,"So, I like making my own transitions. And it’s pretty hard to do went you can’t rotate the material without losing the position and size. I would appreciate it if was easier to rotate. :) all in all it’s pretty good! I would definitely recommend."
3,Domino76570,"Random videos I made suddenly stop working. The pop up thing says it can’t update and it won’t even let me into the vid. Stuff I’ve worked hard on have had to be deleted cos I can’t do anything with them.   Also, I’m unable to do animations and stuff like that. Please fix it"
4,sl09325,"CapCut is such a great app and SUPER easy to use, but for the text I think you should add the text explosion like on video star :) but I’m living all of the cool updates :) Amytike I want to export an edit it never takes long and it’s so easy!"
5,M i a s e v e r i n o d i a z,I love the app it is a great app for editing although it is starting to have some problems but i know that can get fixied soon. But anyways it is a great app yo edit on and people even call me the perfect editor.
2,Youaresocoolthatyoufarted,So I have switched editing from capcut to another editing app because it’s is so so so annoying when it says “too much storage” and I deleted like almost ALL my apps and photos and still says storage is full. I am switching editing apps and I will go back to capcut when they get this fix not worth deleting photos and apps AT ALL :/
5,itz_madmax,This app is AMAZING! At first I thought it would be one of those apps where you have to pay to basically do everything. IT’S NOT THAT WAY. You can use so many affects and transitions. I use this app for editing videos for TikTok. THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!
5,mai🦋✨,"capcut saved my life! it is such an amazing app and don’t get me wrong but at first I didn’t know how to use it but i learned on my own and know I have a successful edit account on tiktok!! it’s free and is better than video star, alight motion. I love capcut!!"
5,Keskskkks,This is app is just AMAZING.I’ve been using this app to edit and when I first downloaded it and I was down with my edit and posted it on TikTok and I got 2.m likes on it.I hope you add more updates to this app it’s amazing
5,Christian.Ayala,"This app is perfect the o my problem I have is it only exports to 1080p 60fps, I loved this app but after working with 2k and 4K clips I had to switch to another app for the quality. Please guys 🙏 add 2k or 4K or both if you can."
3,Boothe Dog,I have 78 photos and it says my storage is full so I’m give me to three and I need to make an edit so I don’t wanna use any other app I want to use CapCut so can y’all fix that they only have 78 Photos so I don’t know why my storage is full and my Settings doesn’t say anything about my storage being full so
5,Shamim Shaimon,"Don’t update this version at iPhone Xs Max...😭After update latest version more options doesn’t work.... effects, filters Text, format etc. Doesn’t work 😰😰😰"
4,Mehiayla,The only thing that I could complain about is fixing the glitch in the new slow motion update whenever I use it theres a green flash that come up and it has happened to me twice now.
5,good app:,i really like the app but i when i deleted some apps to make a edit it kept saying the same thing over and over again i had to delete some of my favorite apps
1,🥳🤩🤪🥰😍,Whenever I’m done editing and trying to save a video it plays the clip then freezes the screen while the audio is playing in the background could you please fix that it’s honestly annoying? And could we add all of the in and out and combo transitions all together instead of them being separate and can a developer please read this you need to fix your app
5,Robert Mitchell Shaw,Honestly i think this app is better than any editing app out there. Its so easy to edit anything a baby could do it. Its sleek and smooth to handle and i haven’t had a problem with it yet!
5,brznis,"This app is so amazing and I recommend this app if for people who can’t have video star I have a cousin who doesn’t understand about vs and she use this app and she said that is so amazing it has transitions,color,key,filters and more:)."
5,Chicken Jeff taco,"I love this, updates daily, new edit choices, and more professional, only thing is, is that there’s one bug to where I can’t export music, please fix this problem🙏 Thank You❤️"
5,dhdisnksnsksms,"So I love this app so much it's easy to use and learn however, there's always pixels in my videos even when I export it in 4k. Can that be fixed?"
5,doglover 🐶❤️ 5/15/11,"My editing has improved so much on this app and it is really simple  to use! if you are someone who isnt that familiar with editing, and ur looking for an easy editing app to use, capcut is perfect for you!"
5,Tan cao,I think you should add a pen so we should trace it and do what ever we like. Another no is adding more effect like dissolve and character black out. Lastly you should upgrade the auto velocity.
3,MiaaaaNiaaaa097,"I hate when I’m trying to do a velocity edit, for example, I put the speed to 2.2x and it goes to 1.0x that’s what it does and I get me madder and madder I try my best to stop the problem but no still does it. I really hope y’all can fix this or I’m going to start using video star"
5,AverageHimself,"As a Tiktok CC I have tried MANY apps to edit and upgrade my videos. Using CapCut has made my life 1,000 times better!  Two things I will say:    It takes a little time getting to know how to use the app. (But once you learn it, it’s a life saver!)    I’d like to see more things removed from behind the pay wall. (Just a personal opinion)  All that being said, it’s a great app! Get it, learn it, and watch it change the way you make content!"
3,chicken man nugget,Yo i enjoy capcut a lot and have been using it for sometime but every time i export some stuff it deletes like all my files but the one I just made its very annoying on top of that some features like there new velocity update has yet to come on my phone im getting annoyed n would like help
4,stallonbreed,"First off CapCut is a awesome app! It’s great for beginners and just editors in general but what I have noticed is the slow mo are really bad like if u want to a slow mo it’s choppy and very bad looking, please consider making the slow mo better other then that I like this app!"
3,rayraythegamer4278,It was a amazing app to start with and help me with my beginning of editing but then it started saying something about payment billing and I’m young so idk and it’s not letting me download anything that is 5 min long so if you could fix that then I would love to come back to being one of your costumers 😉😉😉
5,kruiz0,"I use capcut to make edits and I absolutely love the app. it’s easy to use and I’ve really improved since! however, it can get really laggy which is annoying but I don’t mind too much lol"
5,mildly inconvenienced,"I am SHOCKED that this app is free. How. How is it free?! It’s very user friendly, and that’s coming from someone with 0 VIDEO EDITING EXPERIENCE! It’s now the only app I use to make TikToks for personal and business use. Please never put this app behind a paywall! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ - A mega fan of this app"
5,fun_Violet,Sometimes it gets a little bit glitchy but it’s great for beginners I recommend it if you want to start editing
5,Craftshyper,"This app is great for people who aren’t experienced at editing, I’ve used this for a couple of months and I’m a pro at it now! Definitely try this app if you want to edit your vids."
3,animal gurl 123 🐹🐱🐶,I love capcut I really do but I’ve been having an issue lately. When I go to make an edit it says it needs access to “ the album” so I click confirm but it already has access to everything!! I can’t even make edits now because of this and it makes me very sad please fix this :(
5,Catluvr123,Would recommend for anyone who is looking for a video editor. I have been using this app for a little over a year now and it has never let me down.
4,Good but problem is deleting,First of all when I used cap cut I have to delete app or picture then it worked but... When I need capcut I will need to delete like 2 picture and 3 app and I think it's not fair to me that I will have to delete something  🙃
5,𝕝𝕚𝕝𝕚 🦄🐶,please put more quality in the Videos new professional transitions new professional effects And I really want it because I want to start editing and I want to start well thaks!
3,blackrxses,"Capcut is fun but only for a short period of time. After a little while of playing I got flooded with bugs. It also requires a lot of storage and uses a lot of memory. I recommend getting everything off of capcut when you can, so you can access it."
5,mochi_55109,This is a very amazing app. I just wish they had a profile you can make so that you won't lose your stuff. Sadly my cap cut restarted and took down everything I was making.
5,Anime👏💖,Everything is amazing thats mostly all I have to say but when previewing the edit sometimes it can be slow or laggy. Thats my only consern. I also love the newish update with the 3D thing its really cool!
4,lindszaey,"i love everything about capcut. i make fancams with this app, people love the way they turn out and so do i! it’s such a user friendly app, and there are only two things i wish i could change.   please, let us rename exported sounds and delete them from our exported library. i’ve searched high and low for how to do both of these things, but never found an answer for them.  this app is a godsend and those two improvements would make this app even better."
5,♣️Xîø♣️,Ok so I know I probably don’t know to much about CC but it is easy to use and It has amazing transitions and as a gachatuber I recommend it but It isn’t that good at animating things lol but I still like it so would totally recommend. :)
5,hOi temie11,I just downloaded it I’m still getting to understand it but it’s awesome you can do so much edit pics make videos and music and voiceover it makes editing easy I love it it’s much easier than I movie
4,🌖🌒,I love this app sm it’s one of the best editing apps out there but I think it requires a little too much storage just to edit it on I literally was in the middle of editing and then it exited me out the app and when I tried finishing the edit all of a sudden it said I had no more storage
4,miniprincesstucci,The app is good but there is a lot of glitches and it will just freeze when I click on the project and when I go on the edit it doesn’t load fast or it will kick me out of the app so can u please fix those glitches
5,professercookiedough,"I love this app because first of all i make gacha videos (just for myself) and it really looks good so 5/5 i will give! Ive been trying really hard to get good apps for my gacha videos and they dont work, but this one does so I LOVE THIS APP"
3,sneezybreezy,I love this app it’s useful but there’s a LOT of bugs 1. It says infinite storage! And I have to delete the app and open it again. 2. It says Couldn’t import try again TO MANY TIMES!! 3. When I’m trying to edit it goes a little bit pixelated. Overall it’s a good app I would say..
5,:)))+$)-;$+83$)3$);,Please let me make more videos I try so hard to do a video and it just says can’t make a video.. please just please let me make more videos thank you..
5,rblxcapcut,"I LOVE IT SO MUCH! It is so much easier then editing on video star 100%. And it’s also free!! It is so useful! One thing, could you make it so you can put an animation at the beginning and end? If no that is fine, just a suggestion. Have a good day!!"
5,popopop3425,"This is the best app ive ever used to edit, everything is easy and simple and has a beautiful Selection of things to pick from BUT pls do a filter or something for the trend shugar crush! Everyone tries to do it and needs help figuring it out!"
3,Käšśïē,"Don’t get me wrong, CapCut is amazing after all it’s just that I wished you could add more layers. Because when I edit Gacha I need about 12 layers but the max is 6 🥺. Oh and when it comes to tweening, I was wondering if you could let us add to our key frames such as the KF tempo because their really slow. Keep up the good work!"
4,Doorkawa,"Great app! Amazing for editing videos. The only thing I don’t like is that u cant control how thick the lines are when you’re making a video. Like say u made an editing and the video zooms out, there’s weird lines framing the video that u can’t control."
5,WingedDino,"My friends have told me to download this app for editing gacha videos, so i did. it seems hard at first but once i got used it, i deleted kinemaster, haha! i love this app because multi layere and many effects are free. way to go!"
4,Aesthetic•BTS,"It’s normally great but lately the animation and effects, and things like that haven’t been working and they’ve been saying check internet. My internet is working but I think it’s the app. I would give five stars but this is a big issue."
5,fartniter,Ok so first off the app is pretty much great but as I was making a video I was adding transitions and I click the Camera Transitions and if you scroll to the very far right it says (and I quote) “Top Rght” so maybe if you could fix it then BAM flawless
4,barbecue bacon burger,"i honestly love this app and all but I have been having so many problems with it saying “ no internet connection “ I have full bars , I tried everything. but the app it self is amazing with editing totally recommend! 💓"
5,keevinanachele,"i really love this app , it allows me to make clean edits without the watermark. My only problem is that the audio is delayed while editing the video but when you export the video everything is synced"
5,Eloise can foght,I’ve used CapCut for two years but I can’t click one he style effect anymore idk if it’s just me can you please fix it- or add it back if you deleted it
2,dayeez,"I get so mad with this because sometimes if I put a video in, it takes all my photos and puts them in my deleted album, it’s so annoying! And then it also freezes my phone and won’t let me close it! It’s a helpful app just that it glitches way too often, I wouldn’t really recommend.."
4,Kall love hockey,So I love CapCut I learned to edit in like 10 minutes! But there is a bug where I can’t use a TikTok audio. It always say I’m not in connection:( I had to re-install the app like 3 times for it to work. Please fix this. Otherwise this app is amazing
3,Josie.glackin🍄,It’s great I’ve used for years but jeeZzzzz whenever a try to make shorter clips for Photos it’s extremely choppy and no photos show up. Whenever I try to make smooth slow motion it takes a whole year to download :\ I use it because it’s the easiest editor app I can find.
5,capcut reviews,I never really liked capcut because i couldn't make velocity edits but now they have the new slow mo and all that i can make the perfect edits. i knew that capcut was gonna make slow mo i'm so glad they are:)
5,Clai3,"I Suggest Using This! One thing, Its the Volume, Its Only changes Slightly.. Other than That The App Its- Just Amazing! I Use It Every Day And I Say I Improve. One Of My Favorite Things i've Ever Downloaded. Thank You So Much To Whoever Made This, Capcut Is Great! Have A Great Day. ᰔ☾˙❀‿❀˙☽"
5,Anna notero,So at first I didn’t rly like it but now that I have a tik tok Account for edits I use it a lot and it’s fun or like to crop videos so I recommend it but there’s also other apps you can use in my opinion capcut  is the best :)!.
5,Saturn *,"Amazing editing app , the only thing I see wrong is it takes up way to much space on you device"
5,yoyis14,"I really like this app and the fact that I don’t have to pay for anything makes it better, but I kinda wish that we had a little more effects like hue shift or warp/distorsion idk"
4,well blocks world,New things to add in CapCut is more combo and maybe you sooner or later have a option to chose both to make your own animation and you can have combo and everything else like normal and more new effects
4,adenrliwongg,They need shakes if they had shakes it would Be so much better and they need constant shakes to where you make your own style of shakes and they need the graphed to where you can make your own graphs where it has 2 circles
5,I am Abe,Incredible features. Accurate AI tracking. Had to check my bank account twice if I had accidentally bought this for $1000 because I can’t believe this is free.
4,somediter,I used capcut for over a month and I have to say it is great. I feel like the chroma key needs improvement and the remove background is really cool but needs improvement. I would really love custom masking that would be cool. I love capcut it’s really simple to use and very fun.
5,maylingoplay,I used to hate the app because I didn’t understand it but I looked at some tutorials and now I make such cool edits and I feel like my tiktok profile if growing so much more! And this app is free and it’s easy to use if u gain practice!
5,m.mxg@n,The content and features you get with this app without everything being stuck behind a paywall is phenomenal! Plus there are minimal ads! 10/10
5,Slasher Icons of Horror,"This is awesome. No other words. You can remove backgrounds without green screen, and that is gonna help me in my upcoming Friday the 13th Fan Film. If you need an editing app or second in command, look no further than CapCut. ☺️Five stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
5,BaNaNa OoP,"This app is very good!! But I do request some things u guys should add...if u guys can add some shake animations, more texts fonts and animations, more auras, advanced effects, and better slomotion"
5,Mayra Pum QwQ,"Ok so I really like this app, but I kinda hate it when it says my storage is full when I delete apps,photos, and it still says that. I really hate it when that happens. Also capcut needs to add graphs."
4,R3d3AM,"The app is good just it say that you don’t have enough storage you will have to delete pictures,apps or edits you worked really hard on even if you add storage to your phone it will still say there’s no enough storage like at all"
2,mikeydeez,"It was nice at first, most of the features that were important in the app were free. As soon as the app got attention, everything costs money suddenly. I get it, devs need the money but like come on… It was the only app that was actually good to edit with because of its features. Now it’s all about money and not the users. Went from a 4/5 to a 2/5."
4,effectswhynot,"Im honestly giving up on this app, for some reason when i use the clips i have at some point it ‘reaches it limit’ and than i can’t see anymore photos, I’d this continues i might delete..other than that the effects are pretty cool."
4,Great app! 😄One thing.... 😩,"This is an amazing app and definitely recommend it! It’s very easy to use and the end results are fabulous no matter what you do! ❤️ However, I wish there was a search bar for the music/audio in the video… 😩😒"
5,Bro Thats Deep...,i don’t usually rate stuff but i’ve been using imovie mainly and it’s great and all but theirs more options on here plus it’s completely free and there’s no annoying logos and watermarks i recommended this to my friends great app
4,J-Man1257,I really love this app it is my favorite editing app but the reason i didn’t give it 5 stars is bc of the “insufficient storage” i would really love if you remove it bc i add one picture and i can’t make an edit but besides that the app is really good
4,Se.A.S,Amazing app great quality but it has one small problem which is Arabic/Kurdish language those two languages are not available so when i write in Arabic or Kurdish the letters separates if this app provides one of these two languages it would be amazing.
4,JESSICA____\\\M,CapCut is an awesome tool! It has almost everything you need. The only think I’m not a big fan of is how much space is requires to save your videos. I will delete apps and old videos yet still not have enough to save a video.
5,crazybird_101,"I’m a Gacha tuber and I do TikTok over roblox dances, since CapCut took away dreamy effects I can’t use the aura effects which I’m concerned about how am I able to edit without aura effect?? Can someone please explain to me how to fix this"
5,preccious$$,"I LOVE the app, it’s useful, free, all in one. It’s so amazing. It’s 1000% better than video leap or any other video editing app on the AppStore. You guys are so amazing. I wish you could add smooth key frames and add your own fonts! But it’s perfect"
4,anime_lover2090,I love making my videos on here and it makes me feel like a true editor for TikTok but on one of my videos it just stayed on 1 photo and my internet was on and working really well. And it just wont let me watch my other ones
3,kribkrob,"I used to be able to use this app with ease, then all of a sudden when I put a 7 minute video in the mix and scroll around to split it, it crashes. Basically saying, CapCut can’t handle big videos? Although I used to do the exact same thing and it didn’t crash."
5,SavageWolfGamet,Ngl: This is the BEST editing app I have ever used (and trust me I’ve tried a lot)! It’s 100% fee and no watermark! Plus it has so much cool features and other things most editing apps don’t have. Would totally recommend to anyone
1,complaining bish,"I wanted to make a edit on capcut and for a week now it’s been saying I have to many photos and projects so I deleted some projects, I now have like 3-5 . And I deleted some photos [around 2K +] and it’s still not working, I even deleted some videos and I have around 20 short videos now. It’s annoying me a lot and all my other editing apps are working but I wanna use capcut for this edit."
4,meowasifnuh,"I really like this app! It has a very good quality, and has NO watermark! But just one thing, I deleted so much photos but it says I need more storage. I try to make edits but it won’t work. Please try to fix that or tell me, what is wrong. But the app is still great!"
5,zizzyissy:3,"This app is really amazing. The fact that it’s free is even better! I use it for all my edits, has really good animations and transitions! I love how you can take the watermark at the end away, 100% best editing app!"
5,Edgardo Zamora,Ok this app been good for editing and awesome but I wonder can y’all add edit key frames?? And like blur shake? And other things that Gonna be 10x times better not saying it’s bad or anything but I used it a lot and if you read this the ty
3,iamnot.,"Should definitely let people make their own effects also some of the effects are old, the valentines,Christmas,Halloween and other celebrities are horrible effects because it looks like it’s from tempo. I recommend this app but it needs more changes"
4,Ayla Stuckley,"I don’t like how when you have a certain amount of videos it says “clear up some space” and i delete some videos and clear my cache and it’s still saying that, can you fix this problem?"
5,i oove it art,100 percent no water mark  You have so much stickers tho please up date it with  A moving background that will be really cool :D 5 stars!  I have made perfect edits with gacha life and gacha club Thanks for making the app your awesome
4,Alykat_808,It’s a really good app for editing! But when I’m trying to make edits that have fast clips the transition buttons always get in the way and it gets really annoying. The slow down could use some work as well. Overall good
4,nnneuhnn,I really like capcut but it would be cool if you added something like we could use other people’s overlays or something like that? And for the silver fish effect maybe make it without the streaks through it and just the wobble?
4,ilovechristianbale,"i love capcut, i’ve been using it for a while! however, ever since the new update, the reverse feature isn’t working (“Couldn’t reverse. Try later”); it’s been like that for a few days, perhaps it’s a bug?"
5,ARat_,"Ive been searching around for a while for a good editing app, and this might be it! I’m not a good editor, and I don’t even know how to use Cute Cut or VideoStar, but I’d recommend this to anyone who’s beginning to edit.  All in all, it’s pretty epic."
5,thethron.e,I saw an ad for the app and decided to give it a try and it has been amazing. So make effects and it keeps yours your videos at it’s highest quality. No looking back!
5,Roblox rue,"I use this for all my videos. It’s great. One suggestion though; could you add key frames to the video effects? Like when you add a blur effect, you can have it fade out using key frames."
5,JessicaMaeB8817,I really love capcut. Its easy to use and if you try hard enough you can make really good edits :)! The new feature where you can sync your TikTok audios into your edits is super useful!!  But I have a question.. What happened to the auto velocity feature?? I cant find “style” and I’m freaking out  I also have some suggestions: -hue shift -twitch shake effect -screen float effect -being able to “apply to all” on the speed of a video   ~^•Thats all from me. Bye! <3•^~
5,adelinebn,i love capcut i have used it for a while now but i wish you could almost make it like vsp (Video Star Pro) but free. if yk what i mean . bc all their stuff cost money and it would also be cool to have a nice ghost effect.
5,taylorswiftfanlover,So i dont know what the graphs thing is when i use capcut and i dont have access to it💅😃. So if you are able to ✨contact ✨ me somehow and explain it i would love that  P.S im writing this at 4:13am
4,gaiimon,Since the last update everytime I add a file imported audio file i cant head the sound please fix this big in the next update so i can continue using this great app thank you
5,i love cap cut,I can’t stand to CapCut pretty quickly it’s really fun and easy to use once you search up some stuff
4,chvjvggjg,Ok so I was using cc the other day and I had the border effect and I looked at it today cuz I wanted to make a edit it was GONE?! Maybe it’s a bug but please fix this. Other then that this app is amazing! But please get back to me soon.
4,Huntress LPS,"This is a great app for editors like me, but the one thing I wish we could do it add blend modes to the text, like you do with overlay. In the app you can add splice for your overlays but you can’t for text, I would love a function for that!"
5,picwles,"I honestly have no regret ever downloading the app, it has MANY features and is the best video editor app out of all the ones I’ve used so far. There is like literally no problems with it!"
4,🖤🏐 ur mom 🏐🖤,"Like if you ever want a good editing app but without a watermark and it’s more easy to do transitions, cap cut is for you!  But the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because of the insane lack of bugs while your editing but over all its a good app."
4,jane blah,So I love this edit app it’s very easy and great but the only problem with it that it always says to fix your storage I delete all my photos and videos but it dose not work who ever made CapCut can you fix this please?
4,AAELGalasso,"Cap cut is an amazing app that u like to edit on. But there are some parts that I don’t like, THE ONE I DONT LIKE IS THAT IT TAKEs up storage. And that’s it. Although it is an amazing app, I don’t really know how to animate bc it takes a bit for me to learn bc I am still learning and it is really hard how to do. BUT IT IS AN AMAZING APP SO BYEEEEEE"
4,Froggyseditz,I love Capcut but I wish we could be able to create custom 3d transitions/animations like a cube or a flip or let us be able to customize the preset animations. I would also like if we could add more than one of the animations on a clip.
5,drpoppasmurf,I’m a beginner at editing and my bestie uses CapCut and she taught me how and I read the reviews and it turns out it’s really great! Like how they have music effects and a bunch more! It always helps me to edit!
2,i need an update!!,"Ok I love CapCut it’s a really easy way to edit videos and I love it so much but when the camera update came and it has filters with music, it worked for a min and when I exported it it won’t work anymore! I tried deleting it and adding it back but it still won’t work please fix this issue for me bc I love the filters btw! 🤍"
4,XxTulipsXD,"This app is really nice and I love it but, it keeps saying my storage is full but it’s not please fix this it’s so annoying how every time I power off my phone or click in to CapCut it says that nothing will work please fix this"
5,Ff998877,"I do recommend the app the Quality and the Way to edit is very easy! ( Unlike other apps ) U dont even need the tutorial U can figure it out easily!  There are a few bugs tho, Sometimes it glitches and freezes but i dont rlly mind it,But sometimes it takes a while for the effects to load  Although its an amazing editing app and 100% One of the best Apps! So i do recommend downloading it!"
5,vivsartstudio_1,"I am a beginner editor, and this app makes it really easy! You can look up tutorials, but I do sometimes teach myself. After using it for a while you get used to it!"
5,Hayden xd,"Look I have been making edits for like 3 or so years, and CapCut is wonderful!  But it’s pretty outdated when it comes to newer edits! There is no 3 D edit stuff, but overall it’s pretty good <3"
4,why no sharks??,"I absolutely live this app! Perfect for short videos or for beginner editors. I do have a suggestion though, maybe for the effects on the adjust tab, there could be keyframes for the effects. Just an idea but i think it'd be awesome."
5,HATE CLOWNS,"There is so many features! For Tiktok, I use capcut to make my videos. This app is so good 😊 ok I have a lot more to say but I don’t want to say.                          You can edit (obviously) and you have filters and you can make overlays, you can animate AND MUCH MORE THIS APP IS AMAZING"
4,bobynna,CapCut is a really good app for me to make videos but there is a lot of bugs in the app because I was trying to add a text one time but the text wouldn’t show up on the screen so yeh.
4,T a r i n YT,"This app is great but kinda needs some help and updates  I use this for most of my stuff its actually amazing tho  I really love it and i think this is needs to add some more effects,  Like : money falling , ok ty for your time"
5,kajjsjsjaka,"I love capcut. It’s great for editing. It’s just that right right now, I deleted bcz I have no storage, then re download it but it’s stuck on loading. It’s not even on my Home Screen. But other than that, this is awesome! And free!"
1,amar1d,When I try to share a video it says I don’t have storage but when I go and look I do have storage and i reinstalled it I tried to make another video and the the video could not be made because capcut could not put the videos together so I reinstalled it again and it said I had too much built up storage but when I went to check I had storage left don’t download this app
5,EsC GAMING,i am so amazed at how many things you can do to your photos and videos with this app!! it’s so awesome to be able to edit your own album and doesn’t cost a penny. thank you!!
5,wElL cOme BaCk GaMeRs,I’m new to editing and I love this app it’s perfect!! But I have 8 photos and 1 video and I still have no storage!! But I’m just asking if you could not put storage into the app it might help millions of people.
5,Siyah345,"With this app I’ve edited sooo good with all my other editing apps. They were a fail🙄, the only thing I would say to change it to change some sounds or add some more aesthic sounds. 💜, bye!! ☺️"
4,poopycrayon9322,"Don’t get me wrong, it’s a good app but sadly I don’t like when even if I don’t have enough space and it needs to export it sadly won’t and once it took almost an hour to export and I was very sad because I had to do it almost a lot of times."
4,allsoskdm,"So this is the only app I use to edit my edits but, it says I have to much storage but I on my have 1 video. And made me delete my edits all of it, so I'm not happy I tried redownloding it but doesn't work. Capcut if you see this can you probably tell me what to do?"
5,JACKIE 81920 😌,CapCut is a very good editor game but it keeps on saying I have to Many Photos in my camera roll but I don’t have that much and it doesn’t let me edit a video because it keeps saying that.
5,★ 𝙿𝚊𝚛𝚒𝚜 ★,So I use cap cut for my edits for 1 year now and it’s great to use I have tik tok so I made my edits from cap cut and posted it on my tik tok account there are filters cool things to use make sure to get the app for some good edits if u have tik tok here’s a cap cut tip. Tip: learn some tricks
1,makawao05,So here’s the thing I would like to experience what CapCut has to offer but how can I do that if I can’t import any media in the app like don’t get me wrong the app looks promising and it looks great I’ve read the reviews and was excited to use the app since I’m saving up for a computer so this would be my alternative for my edits but sheesh i think there’s some type of bug that need to be fix
4,mishakoppisetti,"i don’t know why more people don’t use this app. it’s genuinely so good, has tons of features that are very easy to work with, easy to grasp editing techniques, and so much more. my only problem is the volume button as you cant really change the volume at all. it doesn’t increase or decrease even when you increase it all the way up or decrease all the way down. but other then volveu-me issues, it’s an amazing app that you should definitely check out! thanks to the creators as well!"
5,chickennuggetsrthebest,"Ohmygosh I just downloaded capcut and I love it already 😂😂 Everything is free which is great and its easy to make videos with. I dont have any negative comments, and I havent seen any problems yet. Keep up the good work! 👍"
4,Dasiy jupiter,I love this app it’s truly amazing! But one problem is that recently I’ve been trying to use the effects and it keeps saying no internet connection why I’m on internet and every other app works
5,Papichulo74,"I started editing just a few days ago and I’m obsessed. I love how CapCut makes it so easy to edit. Not only that, but if you practice hard enough it turns out amazing 👏 If I could give this a million stars I would."
5,Tristen Collins,One of the best editing apps I have ever used. No watermark and fantastic choices for effects and animation. I definitely recommend this app if you like to edit it’s really good and even simple to use. :)
5,malloryg18936,This app is the best editing app ever!! No watermarks so I don’t have to crop out anything!! It took a little for me to figure it out but I also like how all of e effects are free!! Everyone should use this app you can overlay and add text!
5,2 Gnz Up,It looks great it takes only a few minutes to figure out the controls and stuff and it looks great and no delay when you export.
5,oof🍬,It’s so easy to use I learned how to use a green screen after I downloaded  But I’m a gachatuber and I don’t know if it has somthing to tween I don’t know what to call it  Ima call it buttons ;v; but can you add a tween button if there isn’t?
4,S.P.A.D.E.,"Turns out that your Video Editor can’t import audio in the video now, so that has to be fixed or making good videos with this thing may not work out anymore."
5,D-S1nc,I was sure at first when I saw the add but it really has almost every video editing tool needed and I wouldn’t be surprised if they made it cost a few bucks soon
5,Aqua Snowstorm,"so i have had this for 2+ days AND LOVE IT, its easy to use No bugs (that i know of) and overall its just easy and simple.  note: if you are not an editor i suggest you learn a tad bit of editing first."
5,teauuu,I love how every effect is free in the app unlike the other editing apps that ask you to pay so you can use other effects! The effects are high quality.😆
3,Bluebreeze03,"If you could make like a select all for the videos so that I can easily edit it will be better, like zoom in the video and I have many videos it’s tiring to make it one by one so if you could do the ""apply to all"" it will be very helpful, beside that everything is perfect"
3,jbckets,I prefer the old text shadows y’all had they looked clean I understand the new shadows you can change the directions and angles but make it separate I wanna be able to use the old shadow that was on the text before the angles were added
5,소녀시대TTS_2oo4,for the next update allow us to edit the animation and fonts for text templates. in addition release the new text animation as well
5,Midoriya Izuku U3U,"It was NOT beginners luck at first , but the game wasn’t too bad ! It’s a really good app for beginners ! I recommend using cause this app has a lot of features to use when making videos !"
5,IT TO THE UNKNOWNNNN,"Over all this is a really good app, but the style option just disappeared! I would very much appreciate if it came back😊"
4,sorry unavailable,So I’m beginner and I really like this app but the thing is I don’t like that I can’t pick my own songs like I can’t type in the song that I want that would really help if you add that thank you otherwise it’s a great app
5,fantasticcontent,I think the app is amazing but I think it should be put as 9+ because it isn’t inappropriate in anyway and it  could also increase downloads.
5,|SimplyTori|,This app is super easy to use and has no glitches! Completely free and easy to make ticktock trends! Has quick velocity and has multiple effects! It’s super easy to use!
5,.vix1x_,It would be so awesome if CapCut added some new transitions the app is so easy to use and I use every time I edit a video! But it would be so great if you add some new transitions and effects!
5,Cookie's and Margot,"Hello! I’m Margot, and I’m a gachatuber. Of you don’t know what that is, there is an app called gacha club that I use to make characters. CapCut is my go-to app when trying to animate, edit, and so much more!! I recommend CapCut to anyone"
4,>;\,"i really like using this to edit things, but for some reason I can access the reverse option? Is it something that needs to be paid for? Cause for me, it’s just gray and I can not press it"
5,vsbsushdbd,This app is not just a Random app it is an amazing app! This is the first app I found text to speech on! No one can beat this app don’t know how people put four 3 2 or even 1 stars on this go download loaded at now! Also it’s free ;)
5,okokkaidj,It’s amazing for like charli edits and stuff but I love how in the new update it’s like Vado on the speed when you speed it down I mostly Recommend this app for editing and if ur a starter look up stuff
4,Robloxforrobux!!,"I love Capcut. It’s my first editing app, but I think it needs some work. I wish that Video Effects overlap the overlays and that you could merge the overlay into a selected part of the video it that’s not already in. But over all Capcut is a good app."
5,I LUV VIKINGS,"This app is very user friendly and when I want to make an edit all I do is take screenshots, screen record, and upload it onto my project and boom all done! I love this app so much"

And then I updated thinking ya would fix it AND delete some of my storage but then it still did the same thing..... I don’t know what is happening? Pls help 😕
4,nxxfridvy,Love this app.. it’s just that recently it became a little buggy… now after I remove my background.. I no longer have the option to upload a different background other than that.. it’s great
4,idhgdhdapkshdiwlwjdh,So basically I wanna make a video but it keeps needing something from my settings so I delete the app to try and make it better but now all my videos are gone AND I CANT MAKE VIDEOS STILL so now my channel is probably going to die
4,Gamer.. Girl.. 123,You should think about it adding sound to camera so you can make dancing videos without having to edit then over with the sound but overall I love this app
3,"',-',","It is good and it's free but I was making an edit with a lot of clips and it was a really insane sort of edit. Basically when I was making it, the edit was glitching like crazy and it just stopped working and it just deleted my entire edit."

3,Toca life lover1805,"So I love using capcut, But theres 2 complaints id like to add. Like the quality, When I zoom my screen recorded videos in, It has bad quality, and a little glichy. And when I want to add a smooth slow-mo, Its alwsys rough, and It pauses the videos to make it look slow. I love the app but,you should fix these!"

4,Lovelynicecaringyoutuber,The app is amazing but maybe can use more effects and more spaces for overlays tried making something with a lot of overlays but not that much spaces for overlays but overall the app is amazing!! My edits are good tho
5,AdamSpideyLopez,So when I first downloaded this I didn’t know what to do but when I found out what I can do on here I was amazed I all of a sudden loved this app so much and I still do your amazing thx
2,lunalolilolcjjdhdhdheh,I’ve been using CapCut for a while now but today something happened.  I was working on an edit for tik tok when it changed all of my text to have these white backgrounds. IT CHANGED THEM ON ALL OF MY EDITS. Some of these edits took hours and now are ruined. This was a really good app but this has made me hate it. And I literally cannot find a way to find it. 😡
3,Chanceofclouds420,"Ever since the update a few weeks ago, the auto captions feature doesn’t work. It keeps telling me to try again later. The main reason I used this app was for the auto caption feature."
4,i dont have name :3,"Capcut is really great but when i try to go in my edits it will stay still for a moment and i have to figure it out,it glitches,but over all pretty underrated and i hope you have a great time! Thank you for reading mine"
5,livy3126,"this app is very good for pre-made transitions and more. If your looking for a app that u can make your own transitions with, sadly this app won’t work. But it does help with combining photos & videos and using cool effects."
3,E name,"I spent 3 hours trying to do an edit and I had to start all over again so then I spent 5 hours remaking it then,  Capcut stated to lag out and now all the videos that I made are all gone. Capcut please try to fix this, I don't know if it is my phone but over all you are a good video editor.🙂"
5,klesher13427,Overall the app is really good but i want to ask if you can add an apply to all animation feature for photos because im tired of scrolling so much for multiple photos.😅
1,my guy chungus,"the first time i used this app was yesterday and it worked perfectly fine but im was trying to edit today but it kept freezing and lagging and i couldn’t see if the transition worked or not cause it was frozen and the only was i could check is if i downloaded the video and the videos take up a lot of space, soooo whoever made CapCut please fix these bugs and lags please thank you. 😟😟"
4,Phoenix Max,CapCut is my favorite app to use for editing video. It’s really easy and simple. One thing about it though is that it kicks me out of the app a lot but that might just be my phone. But this is most definitely one of my favorite apps to use!
5,Mikochan2011,"I love CapCut so much! It’s the best video editor i’ve ever seen! the only thing is that when i download a font to it, i don’t know where to find it! i looked at text and it wasn’t there and i kept checking and it’s not there."
5,cxScythedcx,"THIS IS SUCH A GOOD APP!!! the edits on this app are amazing, it’s free and doesn’t have a watermark. Genuinely amazing, all though. When applying effects I wish there was a “most used” or “recent” feature, that way I could apply effects easier"
5,Køøkie🌸,"Not only does it have no watermark and pretty much has everything free, after awhile, it gets super easy to use! I’m really happy my boyfriend recommended me this app :) super helpful for editing videos!"
5,SMJ1220,This app is the best super easy to use you don't need to pay a lot of money just to get a certain tool not like in other app all the things you need for video editing is here.
5,KungFLU-2020,This is not technology! This is sorcery and witchcraft! And easy to use. I highly recommend this app for the creative type.
1,sikohead,This app is very helpful but this past few hours I have been trying to click on the effects and the stickers button and it is not letting me What should I do? I restarted my phone and even deleted the app and redown loaded it again and it still won’t let me edit and add effects and stuff pls help if anyone knows anything pls respond back
2,oooTraciGooo,The app is really good I love editing with it but if I edit it with it the videos get laggy and messy which just ruins the whole thing so you can’t actually edit much or the video will turn out to be a mess. Like what happened to me I spent 4 hours on a video and it turned out VERY laggy so now I’m very upset because I thought this was a  good app please fix this I’m crying
4,noehmi loera,Everything is amazing just when I want to do an auto velocity I can’t because it takes so long it starts at 25% and takes 2 minutes to go to the next percentage please fix this.
3,ᴍᴀɴɪɪ,"Hey, Ive notice that when I finished editing, everything was on beat until i go into my photos and everything is just a bit late. This made me upset and made me work for minutes trying to get it on beat. Can you please fix this?"
5,yhgdyenuxmuemimjfi,"Most of the editors need more transitions, it’s an issue because we are trying to make different things but I can’t. Please add more and better transitions."
3,Javier Avi.,"The style button is gone, and prior to that I always had it, but now I’m trying to make an edit and I go check and there is nothing there that pertains or even is the style, I tried searching and only a few have been noticing it."
4,aaden zone,I’m a new editor Check me out XeditA but anyways add Auto save I was editing for 2 hours and lost all of it because my iPad died and it didn’t save the effects so make it where effects are saved
4,rating amazing stuff,It’s so good for beginners and I use this all the time but skipping to the part I dislike is that it takes up like 1gb for a single video and my iPad only has 32gb so I just delete the app and re download it but still please fix this
3,Yourlocalfr0g,"Capcut is an anazing app! It is free and provides everything you could get in paid apps. But, it glitches saying my storage is full, I check and it’s not. This means I have to delete the app over and over again because if I try updating it, doesn’t do anything. Really annoys me."
5,Nicoloud,I really like this app and it’s very easy and I’m loving the new update they did with their app. But honestly maybe some 3D stuff would really make the app so much better.
5,Alexa81727379283747,"I made a lot of good edits with capcut, amazing app. I think that this app is the best app i have used yet because alot of editing apps cost money for alot of effects, and has ads, capcut is 100% free and has no ads."
5,Foley335,This app is very nice and easy to use! I have used this app many times and it is so amazing! I love being able to put music over my videos and putting transitions!
5,J-2tha-jay,This is a very great app for beginners because you can access things really easily and very compact. I have started using this with great confidence. This is very well for a iPad and phone.
3,isabbellbell,Hello! This app is amazing for my edits! Love it. But can u add something that would be very useful? I just deleted an edit I did and I worked on it for an hour and i deleted it by mistake.  Can u please add “ See deleted projects” and u will see the edits u deleted and u can recover them.  Thank u so much. It would really mean a lot! Bye
5,Waitwhosbrii,I’ve been using CapCut forever to edit vids and post them on social media. There are so many cool effects and options for everyone. I highly recommend.
5,Littlewoofwoof,It’s really a good app but there is one thing that I hate so sometimes when I’m working on some videos and it’s like 4-5 mins it lags badly and skips some parts overall good app!
5,food DOGS,This is great for beginners! It’s also SUPER easy to use!  but there should by a beginners guide when you start. I had no clue what to do when I got this I would like this to get a developer response but great app tho!
1,Glizzy gobbler 366,My You better try to make a movie but he said it was too hard and I think we’re gonna make it like a little bit more easy to edit the videos and graphics trash not even that good and I think that they should add 4K cameras there because honestly it’s not a very good quality movie maker I think that you guys should add that you guys should add more than you should
1,Aarijayy,"It’s a good app, has good features and good quality (and I might only be doing one star cause I’m mad), but when I was trying to make an edit the timing was OFF. Every time I saved it was one second less and the audio was late. No matter what I did it still didn’t work, and obviously with the sound off it’s not gonna be good. So can you guys fix your app please like you’re my #1 editing app so… yeah."
5,_dont_make_fun_of_me_,Capcut is the best!!! It is completely FREE!!1!1!1 I would say to download this app! It is very good editing app and it is amazing to use. A lot of people use this app so why not get it if you don’t have it! Just saying in my opinion.
4,TheOfficialToyGal,i love this app and im glad i got it because its one of the best editing apps EVER but why do the tiktok audios never work for me ummm like i have a lot of favorited audios and obviously an account so why does it say network error…im on wifi and the connection works uh
3,thomas x goehring,This thing make no sense with storage Especially for gacha makers! Every time I make something it will say at least seventeen times “Inefficient storage” PER PROJECT I screenshot to much so the five apps I deleted did NOTHING  The ONLY TWO reasons I don’t use another app is because it’s simple but looks good and you can delete the watermark
4,Marcelozor_on_youtube,I like CapCut the only thing that I don’t really like is how the remove background isn’t that good I’m trying to make a edit but chroma key and remove background don’t work it’s just removes like half of the character
4,I can't save,Ok so I do love the app it’s really good for beginners but the thing is it is asking me to allow me to access saving videos and so I can make videos because I already let them access that CapCut plz fix it if it is a bug or something
5,😆𓆩😀𓆪 🤘ASH,"When I join the app, sometimes it wont let me click a project, if the developers read this please fix the problem."
4,_______^gg,I love capcut!! But there are ALOT of issues!! 1. I get this weird whirl when I try to edit snd its very annoying 2. When Im adding overlays My previous clip gets all blurry 3. It deletes my text when ever I add numbers!! And more. If you guys could fix this it would be awesome!!
3,BOBA OOF,The problem is it says I can’t export my video because I have a bunch of storage but the truth is I deleted all my photos and videos on my gallery and 8 of my apps that I don’t use anymore and now you guys are saying I have a bunch of storage? Ugh it’s not fair but it’s a good app
4,ewt bogees,The app is amazing except for the “clean up storage” button when I go to make a new edit.I had to delete almost all my photos just to make a edit that is 12 seconds long.😐Other then that the app is pretty good.
5,209292,"10/10 love this app, only thing is that I did need to look up to do stuff, although I thought so but I started editing here and now I use other apps but I use this app mainly"
5,jdjjxhshs,Is there anyway I can get my old videos because I accidentally deleted cap cut and I read downloaded it and now I can’t get my other videos please help if you can
5,Sister4,"When I started using this app, I never went back to any other ones. He has everything including text customization, great animation, and many wonderful video effects!   However I would like to be able to pin different edits onto the main clip so it sticks to it. So when I drag the clip to a different spot all the edits under it will stick to it!   Please add this feature!  This is truly a amazing editing app! Thank You!"
4,AnzBonz,So I have been using this app for about an hour or two so far and I noticed that I cannot move the text around when I tried once. It is annoying. Please fix this bug.
5,Quinn Shepherd,"This app is AMAZING. when they have updates, they also turn out good. It’s super easy to edit and the edits are usually good! For me, I like editing things, if they turn out bad, that’s just because of me. Overall, IM OBSESSED!"
5,Tour4life,This app is so great! I’m never ever going to use a different editing app! One recommendation is that you if we can get an option if the effect will show on overlay! Otherwise I love this app!
5,what sdo rate your game,This app is a really good app for Beginners and even I started on it I now edit on alight motion but if you just started editing or you want to just have fun download this app is also can remove the watermark of alight motion
5,lifewithmeclown,This app is totally worth downloading it  I give it 5 stars . And everything is 100% free and there is no watermark ! U can but multiple layers and thousands of free stickers and a lot of effects and filters this is the best app for editing !🫀
4,alex 2.63 gacha,Dont get me wrong I love this app! But I have a suggestion. When you put a transition and crop it a lot I think maybe the transition should stay so you don’t have to go every video having to put the same transition. Overall a good app! ✨
4,reeeę,"Don’t get me wrong here but this app is amazing! The only thing I hate is that when you put your overlay on your video it goes up front. In my opinion, there should be a choice so you can have the overlay up front or the back."
5,Kittengamer3234,"I love this, but it’s hard to rotate stuff without resizing it, so it would be nice if the was a feature where you can choose if you’re rotating an image or resizing an image."
5,bellanatorz,"There’s no watermark and you can literally take out the ending!!! And when you add a sound, you can use videos!!!!!!! it’s amazing!!! I’ve been using KineMaster this whole time, but this app is way better! (And yes I’m not a bot- ;-;)"
4,Sasa Belle💖,"I’m a youtuber and I edit videos a lot. This app makes my videos very nicely done but it takes up a lot of my storage, therefore I had to delete it. It’s a good app but it isn’t good if your running out of storage. It’s amazing for edits though!  Sub to me Sasa Belle  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
5,hahdhhriske,"This app gives you no water mark, has tons of features you can use, and overall, pretty easy to navigate. This totally deserves a five star rating"
4,Roblox9990,It’s great but I’m working on an edit an I have to keep going back to “Distort Right and I have to do that to over 50 photos☹️ So can you add something when you can add animations to favorites so it’s easier for everyone?
5,calm and curry,"Literally the best editing app I’d had so far, but could be so much more better if they had a drawing tool! They have audio, effects, stickers, but no draw? Come on now man!"
4,Saedgirl6,"basically what the title thing is. u should let us have an account so we have all our edits&drafts on different devices. bc i have capcut on my phone and ipad and the edits are not the same so it’s frustrating. it also has become a little laggy recently..? please fix this, also please add smoother transitions!! like simple but smooth!! so please stop the lagginess, allow us to make an account and sign in w it to multiple devices, and add smoother simple transitions"
5,Osebud-Ray,"The best editing app I’ve ever used! I’m really proud of what I’ve made with it! The controls can be difficult for one to use if you aren’t already used to editing software, I got the hang of it pretty fast"
5,Giorgio A.10,So this app is overall REALLY good so the only complaint I have is not having a graph for the key frames to change the speed if CapCut could add that it would be incredible
5,That1ChocolateBanana,This app is soooo easy to use. I really enjoy editing randomly and this is the best app I’ve found. There are so many great features. I made a commercial for school with this and it turned out AMAZING.
5,alibeary9,So I bought this and Video star (year pro). I expected the video star to be better but I tried this and. WOW! I love them both so much! If you are looking for a free editing app with no watermark then this is the app for you!
5,AGallegos702,I’m not sure if y’all added a update or something but when I try to edit it lags ALOT I mean ALOT and don’t get me wrong this app and is best it’s just idk if it’s the app that’s making my edits lag
5,josefn5829/02,"I love the app but you could add a few more mask and maybe better intros, like the spinning top but maybe take off the spinning part it would look way better"
2,Hahfksjjf,I’ve just started using this editor it was good until I started to use overlays. Once I went to use overlays it wouldn’t appear on screen or that it was onscreen but it wouldn’t let me move it. There was just a green box I was moving. And every time I do it and put the overlay in the video I can’t see it in the video. I expected better.
4,kaleoking,"It’s good. Has a lot of cool features that you could use in a video. Unlike most apps, they have transitions you can use for free. However there’s a problem. When you use too much videos, the app will lag and not load the video properly. Overall the app is very good."
3,fix it pls1121,I love this app I’ve been looking for something with no water mark and great effects and transitions the only this is when I put two effects it Glitches also when I have transitions on my photos and make the photos shorter then transition don't work that’s all😊
4,STATE FARM YUS,"hii!|I been using this app to make edits I haven’t used this for to long.I’m trying to get the velocity thing but I can’t see style?whatever I do which is Update,Go back Etc it can’t work! Can u tell me what’s wrong?"
5,naleyanna,"I love this app for the fonts and the slow motion, but please bring back the style button for the velocity please. i used this app for my edits a lot i really like this editing app . Please bring it back 💕"
4,Susy_Darby,"This is an amazing app! There are some problems tho :( first of all 1) when i am making a video, and adding and overlay, it always says i don’t have any photos in my gallery, i’ve tried uninstalling it so many time and the reinstalling it but nothing, all i have to do is exit the app but it’s so annoying! 2) I have to flip the screen around even when screen rotate is turned off, this used to not happen but it’s getting very annoying now.  that’s all! <333"
2,the shcret gurl,"I made a video, it was 1 hour but I shortened it to 10 minutes so I’m almost done with it but I added one more thing to the video and it just started flashing and stuff. It moved all my edits around and now I’m just so mad because not only did it move the edits around by itself but it deleted some stuff by its self too like ugh!!"
4,oskaoakaaia,It’s not bad it’s just that whenever you use the sound and if you want to add a photo it won’t let you so you have to refresh but I like the app because It helps me a lot when I want to edit
4,Tedison7787,"With this new Smooth Slow Motion update, whenever it processes it gives me a totally random clip in the video. It’s okay since it’s a new feature but I just want to let you guys know if it can be fixed."
3,Promisse Calloway,"I just redownloaded CapCut today and when I tried to edit a video and it was too laggy and CapCut never used to be this laggy. I am on iOS 15.4.1 and there is nothing wrong with my phone. Until the tech team fixes this problem , three stars for now."
5,lupita00000001,I really enjoy editing my videos  it’s really easy to edit vids on this app I really recommend using this app before using other editing apps!
4,gacha Taylor,CapCut’s amazing but I wish it had a display model though it would’ve been cool if you get this could you make another update about it that would be cool but this app is really amazing though 😊❤️
3,ZSBBM,I’ve many people showing how they click style and then the velocity option and the video is automatically edited but I don’t have that option I’ve tried updating twice now and I still don’t have the option :(
4,Yolanda1329,Hi I really like this app! It’s great for editors that want to use effects on their videos. I just have a small question. Why do I only have 3 options in “Style”? I’ve seen people have many options in “Style” but I’m wondering why I don’t have them.
5,Haewon😍,I saw that capcut had a update and when I updated it nothing changed. I saw that people got like velocity and stuff but I didn’t. Maybe it don’t work for iPhones 🤔
5,idk if the app gives u tobux,I love this app so much I make all my Gacha vids with it I have this a five star my friend has it there’s no adds so that’s good I been looking for a  app like this for a long time tysm for making it😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
5,adamgoodnan,Cap cut it completely free and has more options and is easier to use than things like splice which cost a subscription
4,Instagram BHADDIEE,Don’t get me wrong I love the app but the way I constant have to delete my other edits to make new ones is very old and annoying. I hate the way that it also keeps telling me my story are is full also. But I recommend this for beginners!
3,itzDANKO,"It’s a good app but cmon with the “no internet connection” when i try to use my tiktok sounds. I’ve had to delete it like 3 times. Get it together and fix that. It’s nothing on my end it’s the app. It’ll work one second then gone the next, that’s really irritating!!"
5,piathegrape_rblx,This is very good for beginners Of Editing! But for the audio it barely work like you can’t cut it properly so that needs some work but this is a very good app for beginners and I’m still using Bc imma beginner also!
3,Itz_Pastel blue,"Hi again!💛 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE! Add shakes like videostar, not the EXACT same but similar please! Make us be able to design our own fonts through the app, and PLEASE overlays like videostar.  Like ae screen float, etc. more like video star to improve better and it will be free! Itll help me alot like if you add more like videostar shake effects and more💛 xoxo camila"
4,sylvia4321,There’s a spot where I delete a lot of my videos in my camera and it didn’t it and it still said that there’s not enough space can you please fix this bug?
5,ksncur,"This app is amazing for beginner editors wanting to get started making TikTok's and videos. There is huge libraries of effects, filters, sounds, etc. I definitely recommend CapCut for people looking for a free editing app!"

5,person-:],So once I exported my edit I realized that the video and the audio weren’t in sync and this has happened a few times now. So I’m just hoping you’ll fix that soon. :)
5,lollovelylauren,Before I was horrible making edits with CapCut then when I actually used more effects it became more helpful and easier for me!Definitely recommend this app it helps❤️
5,fun but …not fun,I got this app when I hadn’t done anything with videos or editing. Now I can make some pretty cool videos. Easy to add audio and texts definitely would recommend 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
5,Muustaine,"As an editor, I personally love CapCut! It can do a lot of things especially make great edits. It also has great filters and effects that make the edits better! Overall it’s a 5 out of 5"
5,XxLayneyNoirxX,I love this game and nothin wrong with it accept I can’t seem to find the right music I can only get different songs and not the ones I want but other than that everything is fine ty❤️😅
4,springlighttime,I love it i love using it but i would like more transitions like short cuts have a lot of transition but there not original edits so I would like more transitions to make the edits even better! Other than that a amazing app I definitely recommend it!
5,gdydbvduehbc5364,"I love this app but you guys change something about the overlay, and now it’s too slow and too choppy when I’m trying to make key frames. Please reverted back thank you."
4,WyattCrosser,Alr so Basically there’s just this one glitch where if you add a key frame it doesn’t put it where you have the white line   (Would Be 4.5 stars chz its not bad @ all its just the glitch)
5,BuddyRossC,"CapCut is an amazing video editor I love all the stuff you can do for free I recommend this if your looking for a free video editing software, I’ve seen people do ROBLOX edits with CapCut and it looks incredible keep up the amazing work"
5,Cocobunnysweet,This app is so amazing everything is free you can make whatever you want to make the effects are so amazing I have been using them a lot! This app is so amazing so I recommend it
4,Lol the potato,"Everything is great, like people have listed but I really want to be able to make videos even with full storage, and be able to review/edit my videos with full storage. Thanks!"
5,hello!imcameron,"I love CapCut. It is an amazing app, I have started to edit most of my stuff there. Plus, unlike other apps, u don’t have the watermark 😩👍 and u can get rid of the end if u want. CapCut is underrated in my opinion"
5,hsuop,This app is amazing no adds no watermark 100% free nothing wrong with it but if your storage gets full it won’t let you use the app but otherwise this app is AMAZING totally recommend its great for editing its just amazing!!!
3,LIVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVAH,"I think that CapCut has many amazing features. For example, many cool effects and editing options. Sometimes this app can be VERY laggy and it’s hard to edit. For example, the audio might be glitching or the editing process might be very laggy. In rest this app is really good for editing!"
5,ceifne,"this app is so amazing, you can do anything and everything is completely FREE! you can do all sorts of things like advanced transitions, text effects, etc. i HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP for anyone who wants an advanced video editor."
5,Amydslefinger,"One word, wow. This...is...SO...AMAZING... I downloaded it for just one edit, but now ill use it for ALL my edits! This is even better than Videoshop, ill delete it right now! It has every feature of Videoshop, but better! (No offense.)This is great! Keep it up!"
5,Reagan a.k.a. axolotl queen,This is absolutely amazing you need it right now you can basically edit videos or make videos this thing is absolutely amazing I totally recommend
4,niki_soot,I love this app so much i use it all the time the only thing is that i think you should be able to search for Music but other than that its amazing and totally beginer friendly.❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎
5,DDBMIIND🫀⚡️🤲🏽,"I enjoy this App No water marks. It’s extremely helpful for me editing my videos musics and Quick trailers! I would recommend this app to anyone wanting to edit, without any problems."
5,MamaGburner,This is a very great app But I have. A request I’ve been looking on Yt And I thought if you could add hayloft edits I’ve always wanted to do one and they seem very fun! Just asking if you could maybe add that!
5,hisoka's gf,I really love this app... My reasons why: The transitions aren’t corny and actual look good. There are so many cool stickers. They gave a text to speech option which is very cool and useful. So many cool effects. Your able to make the quality of a video/picture very good. IT’S FREE A NICE WELL DONE APP FOR FREE!!! You guys should keep it that way.😉 /hj I do have a suggestion tho...could you guys maybe consider adding graphs to key frames? It’s totally ok if you guys don’t I just think it would be cool.🤔
5,isabella0728,I love the app so much the only thing I don’t like is that it freezes sometimes when I’m trying to edit like the video itself freezes:( but overall I love the app!:))
5,CallieKiwi🦋,This is by far the best editing app out there. there are hundreds of filters and transitions that are all free which give the app great quality. 10/10 would recommend! Great for beginners!
2,madelleine devault,I have made an amazing edit it took exactly 30 minutes to make! And right when im about to post it a big glitch stops the video from going on. It freezes and wont let you watch the rest. Terrible app this app disgusts me for the fact of it ALWAYS freezing. Thanks for wasting my time on your stupid app capcut.
5,gigigigifigigigigigigi,This app is really good for making edits for tiktok but Im having an issue. Sometimes when im clicking an effect it’s saying I have k internet connection when I do. Can someone fix this?
2,shewholovestoedit,First off love the app works amazing   Just wish it had better transitions for it other wise i love it because I edit a lot for my fan accounts would definitely recommend for first time editors who are wanting to learn about editing stuff :)    I’m glad that it has a free use option for every transitions for beginners
5,cindyrobledo,"I’ve never been so happy with an app like this one it’s the best, it’s easy to use, has a lot of options you can use, and the best part it’s free!!! I don’t regret downloading this app at all😁"
4,OP Nate,Ok so there are so many things I love abou th is app it's just the RBI no tutorials of how to do so you just have to figur it out your self and picking where you want the to start and the transitions are very challenging but otherwise great app : )
5,coconut-v-,You help so many pepole achieve there dream on editing and become TikTok famous you help me do my stuff on here even my friends love it I use it for everything every day Tysm for making this an app
4,lunamacar00na,"Luv this. Very good for beginner editors, but I was making some stuff and switched my camera around, tried to turn it back and it wouldn’t change back to front camera. Please fix this!                         -me"
4,NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL,Am I only getting the problem with not getting my TikTok audio favorite saved files? Everything else is great but I would hate to do the trick to download manually for the audio and extract. Help.
1,Auzzie910,I am connected to internet I was doing an edit when it just wouldn’t let me use it! It said “try again your not connected to internet.” I refreshed and everything! And it lets me upload certain photos but not the ones I need to! So I deleted the app it still didn’t work. Now all my things are gone and y’all lazy behinds have a broken app. It’s not working!
3,khgbnn,So sometimes when I need to add a overlay all my pictures disappears and says I have no photo in here but I DO!  When I also add a audio and leave the app just a moment and came back and the sound is like in HALF! Please fix these it keeps happening to me.
5,Hubcap61,"I make all my Tik toks on CapCut, and it’s so easy to learn how to use. You can make amazing videos on your phone by simply using CapCut. This app being free is truly incredible and I absolutely love it."
5,DaGachaBexFan,"This app is amazing! Especially with the new velocity feature! There's just one small problem. Whenever I try to add graps, it glitches out and doesn't look very clean."
5,michael67834,There’s not that much space to do lots of edits and the app is great just give us more storage to use I have 1 video and it’s not letting me do anymore it’s stupid
4,catty204,I love the app and it’s easy to do transitions but it doesn’t give me a very big music range I would love if you could make a area for people to search up music instead of having to pull it out of videos
5,lovley mary,I’ve started capcut about a year ago and it’s been the best decision I told all my cousins about it and we all mastered it completely ive tried other apps but nothing could beat calcut.
5,peanutmnm0807,So I am a very successful YouTuber with horses and I have lots of trouble trying to make my videos on my channel. I came across Cap Cut and I thought i was living in a dream! It is amazing and I totally recommend this app
5,hud and i,It’s super easy to use you don’t have to pay it’s completely free no memberships no adds it’s great for me to edit videos for friends and you can use it on the go
4,ThatGirlWhoImproves,Some effects don’t work and can i request music onto the camera part and i would like it if you could preview the video before it automatically saves
5,maya Delphene,What regions do you have to be in to use templates i just wanna know because i could use a VPN to access the template feature sorry if this is a bother Bye.
4,Nick573847472,Okay I love this app but I have a compliant… when trying to tween it gets upsetting because when I’m working on the head it won’t turn which gets me really upset.. but this app is amazing! It has lots of cool affects and stuff like that.
4,strongbutterfly,I would say this app is very good but there one thing that I think needs to be fix so when I put an effect it shortens my video and it’s really annoying to adjust each snap of a video
5,iyahna green,And I revealed is 10 stars it’s just great it’s so easy to edit I get views that for me it in a blow up so you know I like this
4,flydowg,"Hi, my capcut is broken and I don’t know what to do but I always have to close the app and go in again. Please fix the data lost glitch thing or bug. It happened to me multiple times."
2,heuebsjsnsv,I just get this app not too long ago and I have noticed that whenever I go to add auto captions it says to create auto captions turn ur volume down. I can only add auto captions by voiceover and it won’t let me change them to original sound. I have heard many amazing things about this app but I am very disappointed.
4,kdkppppqowijehdbdbxksk,I like this app! Easy to use but also give me a challenge like key frames and all that. I just hate that I have more than enough storage but the app says I need more and I can’t delete anything because of school apps and that stuff. And NO WATERMARK WHILE EDITING THANK GOD!
5,sarahs rock,The app is good I love it and I love editing on there but I which when I do the camera focus thing we can have key frames so the blur and go faster but love the app
5,LauraAnnK,My suggested I get this app and have not played it but it seems great and it seems like they worked really hard to make this so good work for the people who made this!💖
5,katelyn_marie_918,"personally, i kinda wish there was graphs to go along with keyframes. this way it could balance out everything between selecting transitions and making your own. i also think there should be more glitch/eyestrain filters. maybe ones that flash faster with more colors? and ones that flash and follow the outline of a picture? i like the app, but it just needs some tweaking."
3,lil_twin1424atlducksselect,CapCut is good for editing but it’s 1 issue I’m dealing with. When I try to edit it says “Insufficient storage. Clean up some phone storage and try again” So I cannot get my videos if that keeps happening and I can’t edit with it. I hope it gets fixed soon
5,Valeria Lps and player,"This app is underrated, it’s amazing my edits look professional! You don’t have to pay anything for anything! No money , no credit cards, and most of all this app is really easy to use! , , OmG! There amazing!"
4,poooooooop star,This apo is amsing all my friends have been using this so tried it out and it was just what I needed but the music there should be more and maybe a serch bar cuz I’m looking for a spasifc song but I can’t find it
5,Josie_The_Loser :],"This app is so great and easy to use!!! There are so many cool stickers, music, and transitions!!! This is SO much better than KineMaster!!!! I HIGHLY suggest this for Gacha tubers!!! I am so happy I downloaded this app! I hope you all will enjoy it as much as I do! :]"
4,deja monkey 17,"I love CapCut for many reasons, 1. easy to edit with 2. fast uploading then most apps 3. it helps A LOT! 4. no watermarks  but…… The amount of bugs it can have is crazy, I have been using cap cut for 2 years now And 2022 has to be the worst the bugs have been.  Weather it’s not loading, glitching to much as I play the video or just exiting out of the app. I’m not trying to complain these are easy bug fixes. Cap Cut is a Great editing app to use for beginners and professionals. Totally Recommend!"
5,itsbongo,"This app is 100% gold good bc I use this when I edit on TikTok and others, it's one of the easiest editing apps to use and I got pretty good at editing on this app. It also has NO watermark? This is amazing thank u so much, btw me TikTok is  koopico 💀🔫"

3,Player365766577($,So I recently used the style button for some edits I was making but I noticed that now it’s missing. I can’t use the auto velocity anymore. I don’t know if it’s a glitch or it was simply just removed but I do hope it comes back

5,Julian v z 2008,"I like it because it’s simple and easy to use. It just needs more stuff. like music, more stuff to edit the videos? That’s all I can come up with.."
2,hdgduc,Everytime I go on CapCut I click it and it says storage full🙄 I delete so much storage and it still says it’s full and that is really annoying but overall the app is okay some bug fixes and it’s a bit laggy sometimes but I still like it tho it’s very good for beginners there’s just some bug fixes yall need to fix

5,Lexie's worldo,I was looking for an app to make gacha videos the first app I found was KineMaster it was really hard to get use to then I found capcut I got use to it in a minute I will never stop using capcut

5,ⒺⓁⒺⓃⒶ ⒸⒽⓇⒾⓈⓉⓂⒶⓈ ⒼⒾⓇⓁ,i love capcut so much its a really good app you can do so much with it just theres a few things that i would want to fix first of all i wish there was a undo button so if you make a mistake u can just undo it second of all when i never add a sound or a song or anything like that when im done with my video and i watch it theres a song that i didnt add but other than that its a really great app
5,Had it!,This app is so good someone made the off-brand version of it and it’s called vita like 😤👌 this app is so underrated it’s awesome and so easy ❤️ I make tons of videos on it (check out my yt channel! Just search up aizen 😁)
3,TPCFUN,I’m a big editor with a yt channel (welcome to camp ash pls sub🥲) I love how easy the app is. But there is some critiques I have to give. I constantly have to delete a bunch of things from my camera role etc. It gets annoying when I have 2 thing Ian my library and it says out of memory.
3,I'm not that racist,Not sure why but recently when I save a video the quality because absolute garbage even though the picture quality is as high as I can possibly have it from the source and on the app and it’s pretty annoying
5,ew cat,It’s fun and it’s a good way to pass time me and my friend send videos and I love the tools you can use but can u add anime pictures because I love going anime edits and it’s great for Gacha life ☁️ and I hope you have a good day or afternoon or Night
2,Khai-luvs-Iida,"I started making edits not too long ago, and everything was great. I could edit as much as I wanted. I added the new update to the app, and I can’t access any of my  previous edits anymore. I’ve been trying to install the “update” it needs so I can just open it, but it never works."
5,kaitlyn_893,"This app is amazing! I’ve been looking for a good editing app, and this is definitely the one; it’s 100% free, no watermark, and the features it has are really cool! I definitely recommend, 10/10!"
5,DeDerpQueen,"Love CapCut so much I definitely recommend it, it’s just that sometimes I can’t move or delete text and I sometimes cant import new things and have to wait"
4,ŃØRÅGĘ,"Hello. I have using CapCut for the fast few months. I think the app is amazing for beginners/intermediate editors. However, I have a suggestion. I think that you should add graphs. Add it to clips, keyframes, and other things. Apart from that, The app is amazing.                         Thanks! -AmazingRG"
1,Jmarny,I tried to make anything but then it saying I don't have enough storage so I delete the one movie I made and then it's still saying I have no storage and then I go to delete some of my photos didn't work so I tried deleting it was downloading it didn't work I tried to go maybe make it again didn't work then I deleted all my tabs didn't work so now I don't know what to do?

4,Blue-DevilOnYoutube,Don’t get me wrong this is an AMAZING app but I keep having my phone freeze and play the music when I am off the app and It kept freezing so I couldn’t see my screen other than that it is a really good app
4,master16158,works great everything is fine but it keeps saying insignificant storage I have like 10 pictures and 2 videos in my camera roll so I don’t see how I have significant storage
5,bacon and eggys,"hey man uh i’m having problems with capcut;  im trying to like make an edit but, it says to confirm so i did but it sent me to my settings? i don’t know what i’m suppose to do.   The app is great but, its just won’t tell me what to do?"
5,Sa'Mia,I love this app! it’s easy to use and is not complicated. lately i was looking for an app that wasn’t as complicated as videostar bc everything was so confusing but everything is so easy on this app. i love it.
5,mdg CCD nzuz,Is a good app to edit on but can CapCut put music when you put a song and when you go on CapCut it just stops 🙁 can you put when you can put music while you edit 🙂
4,80sdawg,"I love this app, it has about everything you could ever need when editing! However, I have found that cropping an image or video degrades the quality TREMENDOUSLY, don’t get me wrong I love this app, but this is a big issue for me."
5,Anne_🍥🍡,I love this app works very well BUT it won’t let me make something because I don’t have enough storage but I already deleted my apps and half my camera roll
4,Mis.cellanenous,I love CapCut since it’s the first GOOD editing app that’s free you don’t have to pay for anything. It’s also really easy to use. I use it mostly to edit yt vids but there’s one thing it needs for edits.. MOTION BLUR! If it had motion blur I would use it all the time.
5,Nessa2025,This is probably the best editing app I’ve ever used. It has the best transitions for videos and it really helps me and others. I love this app and plz don’t change it to be like the others.
5,nickname123456785467'jb,I love capcut I have been using it to make tiktoks or just videos for fun.. It is really easy to use unlike all the other editing apps I have downloaded. Plus it is 100% free which is the best part

2,333131914918x19.21.x,"This app is amazing and everything, however for the past 2 months it just tells me I have no internet. I’ve tried everything. Updating, reinstalling, not using it for a while. Nothing works. I have no clue what’s going on but this “glitch” going on does not make me enjoy the app."
4,Emma Cat Amazing Adventures,"I love this app, it’s one of the best editing apps I’ve used. BUT, where did the style button go on my app? It’s nowhere to be found! I seriously saw it yesterday, but not today? What happened?"
5,syd tom,The style button is gone and I think it’s a glitch even seen you added the new style.
4,Socailpoint lover,"I've updated. Easy, fun, useful, but where are those new frames and the turn you into a drawing thing? I've even deleted and gotten the app again and no success. Can you please fix this?-"
4,jjhfeuvhfeve,I love this app a lot but when I tried to find the new affect y’all added I couldn’t find it. Everyone is asking for it back so can you bring it back?
5,charlie_evans42,You guys should definitely add more amazing text to speech voices!! I love this app as well I just think it would be more great if you added more text to speech voices!!
5,Xen.Ziv,"This app is honestly amazing. All the other apps you have to pay for, but this app has basically everything and for FREE! I love it and it's the main app I use"
4,hohihihhihiihhihiihihihih,This app is great in all but there is a problem. I have seen people make templates by clicking a button on the bottom of their screen and I dont have that? I want to make a template so I don’t know what to do.
4,SaddeningMyWork,"I really like this app, but when I had to update my phone all my apps reseted and my project was gone!! I think we really need accounts because I lost all my hard worked project"

5,jaqueie bonet,This app is so good omg it literally has sm features that other apps would normally charge a subscription and it’s easy to use
4,kyndell the taco,So the thing is great with all the effects and stuff but the thing is that when I have a lot of photos to use on there it just says insufficient storage that’s supposed to be used for my edit idk what’s wrong.
3,Notsogamez,I can’t even download the app when I do it doesn’t even go through I love the app and it’s amazing but when I tried to download it on App Store it wouldn’t work I want to give it 5 stars but I can even download it so I will give a 3 pls fix the app downloading process.
5,..UvU,Best editing app ever I have went from being the worst editor on capcut to being a really good one this app has taught me a lot of editing skills that I never knew I could do
5,SuGaRpAnDaUwU,"Hi! Uh so this is an awesome app and I’ve improved my editing on this, and I have a little complaint 💀. If I go into camera, I can’t flip the camera to where it’s pointing to me! Please fix this! Thank you 😊"
5,1lilkjfp,Love everything about it but you guys should make it where we can use key frames on the effects available
5,glitz123xoo,"can you add more editing? add pictures and can you add drawing? it will really help me out with making an gacha intro, thank you if you add editing and drawing it will really help so much :D"
4,Me when your mom- me when-,"Cap cut is great! It’s very easy to use, but the only problem is sometimes it get’s glitchy if you add a lot of “animations” or just a lot of clips in general. But I’m updating mine now— so that might also be a reason for it. Besides all of that it’s great!"
4,teamzmat,It’s a really good app I highly recommend it. But when I transport videos to my gallery the video is slower than the audio or the other way around. But for me that’s it I really like it though 😁
3,mish moshy moo,"I only rate this 3 stars because.... THE STORAGE ISSUES. I constantly have to delete apps and videos just to access it, and it sometimes doesn’t even work! Even Picsart is better than this! Ugh! I just wanted to do a simple video! Ofc it’s easy to use and beautiful, BUT THE STORAGE PROBLEMS!"
3,streliteia,"Capcut is great and all but, I just deleted capcut to redownload it so the storage is gone. But sadly for some odd reason instead of that it is stuck on loading, meaning that it isn’t downloading yet, it is loading, I have been waiting for 5 minutes, is this a apple bug or?"
4,Absvdhdbgd,"This app is great! I love it but I do have a few critiques, please let us use multiple animations on one clip and pls do better green screens Bc sometimes it’ll glitch and one of my pics will bleed into the other pic :)"
4,Hot baba girl hottie dadi,Me out too many times and the loading is fast but sometimes it can glitch and u have to do it again pls fix these it bothers me
5,maya the raya,My cap cut kept glitching so took it off and when to download it back it did not do it please fix this bug
5,joyce 😝,I had CapCut for a couple of months and got it cause I saw it on tiktok. It has made my editing better than before. It was pretty simple to use and easy. I’m not lying but it’s really good!
5,분석하다,Everything is so good but just one think CapCut can you make slow motion so when I do roblox edit I can make it look slow but great so can you do that thank you capcut🥺☺️
5,Samryoo1231010,Just made a fire anime edit using this and normally editing apps would ask for a subscription but nope everything was free 10/10
5,majdbdndhhdjd,This app helps me with tiktok and editing videos I love it some much I never thought I would find a app that is so good but free I will tell my friends and family about this app
4,JOLLYHOLLYCOOKIE!,Okay So This Is A Pretty Awesome App! i love it except sometimes when i am making something it freezes up that is the only problem but it does not happen very often so it is still a great app!
5,MilestheDrummer,"Don’t usually write reviews but this editing app is the best free app I’ve ever used and that’s not an exaggeration. Ultimate freedom, no complaints whatsoever. Love it and 10/10 would recommend."
4,kookiescrush,"I rate this app a 9.5/10. It’s good and all but I suggest you to update CapCut so that it wouldn’t lag once we edit to a certain part of the video. It lags like crazy to the point to where it’s impossible but besides that, I really love it!"
4,SmhBleh,"i'd REALLY like to put on an intro animation AND an outro on the same section, but it's either one or the other. also maybe more specific masking? it's hard to mask a specific area using the current shapes"
3,yourlocalhoelmao,"This app is amazing and very helpful, but I can’t help but notice that we cannot name our extracted audios, which is a bummer. It would be helpful if I could do so so that I wouldn’t have to look through all of my audios to find the one I’d like to use. Please make that available."
5,cant say🐀🐀,"I was using cap cut then it’s just said u need more storage so I deleted one app and 300 and 83 photos and it still said that then I deleted 1,000 and it still didn’t work"
5,cleetus the yes the yeetus,"It has text to speech, original transitions, cute text options, it’s everything i need. Even effects and fonts, and masks too. I really recommend this app. Bye bye, KineMaster."
5,apesmurray75,"THIS IS THE BEST EDITOR IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD! The best thing is that unlike KineMaster it does NOT delete the photos after a month or two. They have amazing effects and transitions, after using it I had no problems at all with CapCut. THANK YOU SO FREAKING MUCH FOR MAKING THIS APP!!!!!! From: Evan"
4,retalskxicjc,Hi cap cut hopefully you reply I’ve used your app for a while and it’s been the best ! Until recently there is a effect you Added that would improve my skills witch is remove background but I’m not getting it pls reply
4,istgjane,"this app is great. Everything is free and easy to use. I only gave it a 4 star because of no keyframes. Maybe there are and I just can’t find them but if there really isn’t any, pls add them. keyframes can make my video edits a lot more on beat."
5,diiinnnaa,This app is really great everything for free like it is  my top favorite editing app but can I ask for one thing please it’s just that can you guys please add the cartoon filter on this please.
5,simpy bish,This app is amazing but for some reason when I use the stock photos/clips when I go to regular photos it won’t show any of my pictures
3,ohh ahhhh oh ahhh,I loved making edits with this easy to use! No water mark! And many more reasons I started using it as my go to but over time when I would try to use the text or effect it would not let me! :(
4,emily-.-,So I love this app! Like so much i have only had it for a few days but I love using it but for some reason I’ll get on the app and then it won’t load and it’s making me sad because I can’t use it:(
5,anime is life 429,"Hey this app is so easy to use and I use it a lot for editing and clips I was wondering if you guys can make a blur type transition like “Blur Zoom out, blur Zoom in, or just blur” please I would love that"
5,Kaelin Go,"This app is great, it does have a little bit of a learning curve but once you learn how to use it you’ll be editing videos in no time. Shout out to the developers"
5,Saturajan,Having internet access but still it doesn't load anything.
3,agamerx98,The app is great in all but when I try to put an transition or sticker it says that I don’t have Internet but clearly I have. It won’t let me load anything or see what transitions I am using. Can you please fix this bug? It’s because I have too much videos in capcut?
5,GizelleVelasquez,I love this app because all the transitions are free you can add many pictures as you want you can add your own sound or choose one of the ones it has there it’s just super amazing😊❤️❤️✨✨
5,SkunkGamer1000,Please do not add in app purchases pls I beg you this app is very powerful and the tools it has are very hard to get for free This is my number one video editing app
5,VRYB,"This is the best app i’ve ever used, the only thing thats holding back my editing just a little is that the slo-mo drops the framerate. Thats all."
4,Crimsongorcutter,This app lets you make really nice videos although it can be a little difficult sometimes to figure stuff out but once you figured it out then it is a really nice app
1,gl1tchyy.b0ii,"This app worked perfectly for a while, and then everything stopped working. No matter what I do, it will not connect to the internet, even though my phone is. Because of this, I can hardly do anything. Also, whenever I click on the ""fonts"" section of the text feature, nothing shows up."
4,Maxxychef,I love this app and all but the reason it’s four stars is because you guys removed styles and it’s harder to make edits/videos on there and I don’t see why there’s a reason to remove it?
5,Kayden73643,So in my phone I’m trying to download capcut because I offloaded it then it wouldn’t download so I deleted it and reinstalled but but nothing worked
3,Cateyuta,Why did cap cut delete style this is the only thing on this dumb app that makes people edits look good. But know y’all delete why? That was the only thing get y’all popular. Not trying to be mean it’s a very good app just put style back in. Thank and have a great day 😌
4,udmskdnsismdnwk,One day I went in cap cut and I presses make one and it said “to much phone storage” and I deleted SO MANY THINGS and it still said that! Please fix this and make it have no limit PLEASE and it will make the app really better. Please and thank you. ☺️
3,gqedits,"Why did you remove the photo stylize option? The big zoom effect has become somewhat of a staple and it’s wild that you’d just delete it without a word. Also, videos have voice effects but solo audios don’t…. Fix that"
5,its kate rose,First when I downloaded this i put photos and put some transitions on them. And it turned out so good! Thanks to capcut. But it could need more text to speech voice's.
5,the 13 year old who wrote this,"BEST. APP. EVER. Perfect for beginner editors or even advanced. Tons of options for every feature, really easy to use, and you can edit everything from the sound, to the transition. AND ITS COMPLETELY FREE NO HIDDEN FEES LATER ON!! Thank you so much!!"
3,a r y a n a,Okay so this app is very great! I’ve been using this app about a year and there are some problems… every time I will try to make a video with capcut it won’t allow me to add photos it just tells me to try again. Please fix this!
5,daphne_carlianne,"works good and is great for beginners. i just started editing and i made a edit with this app that got 20k likes on tiktok :) the only thing i would change is how when i try to watch the edit while im working on it still, its fpm (frames per minute) is bad, but then when i export the video the fpm is good which is weird lol. overall a good app and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to start editing ."
5,come back to me jill,I can’t download the app :’) it might be my device but I’m only saying this to try to see if anyone else is having a problem.
4,zbb j. zH🤯,"I REALLY wish that I could RENAME the sounds that I’ve extracted from videos. Instead of playing all the sounds I’ve extracted to see which one I want, I can just pick the one that I want because it has a name."
4,Dez❤️✨,"I have been very happy with the app and still am but when I make velocities now it makes a certain sound, almost like a record scratching. It’s strange and ruins the quality of my videos.."
5,K!TTYSBLUSH,"CapCut is a great app! I admire how everything is free but, I do not like how the animations are not the best- everything else like some of the effects, they are really good for edits. That’s all I really have to say! Keep the great work CapCut! <3 ^^"
2,A$$h013 ni66a,It is very good app to use for editing but there is this one problem whenever I wanna link my TikTok account I always have lots of problems and it never works so if I want to use a sound I have to manually save a video from TikTok and use that sound instead of using the use favorite sound feature.
4,Lemon Demon Rates,I recommend adding more of a smooth slow-down! The slow-down option makes the video laggy and not as smooth so I wish you guys to add that!
4,Carter Oum,"The app is great but it needs one little thing. When I tried to import a photo in, it said, “No internet. Please try again.” even though I had internet. So, can you please fix the bug?"
4,🦩Haydee🧋,Okay I love this app and there is so much good stuff but it’s about when you have TikTok and want to go put TikTok sounds you need to sign in? But what if you are already signed in.I just want you to fix this please I want to put good sounds
2,benndndd bd f,Hey to I have been seeing people with the velocity button and I looked and I didn’t have it the first time so I updated it wait a few days and I still didn’t have it . So a couple days later it tells me to update it again so I do I wait again and I still don’t have anything how do I get this
5,chdncht,I love using this app for editing but I would really appreciate if there was a old age filter. Overall this app is the best I really recommend it to people who need a editing app.
3,Kailychau,Capcut is great for a editing app but it is SO annoying for when I try doing velocities edit it literally changes the speed I can’t put where I wanted so I’ll probably use another editing app intil you fix this.
4,rewindsn,I love this app so much and how it is an app for beginners but my one thing I don’t like about it is when I export it and it is super delayed! For example if I time pictures to the beat when I export the video they are very delayed.
5,awadiaaaaa,I really really love the new update now they have a very smooth velocity  No need to pay  CapCut is a great app for editing  Because I’m always editing and they just did me a huge favor
4,unknown wof,"i love this app and i use it all the time. there’s only one small problem. my photos are enabled and when i try to add a photo to my edit, the photo screen is just grey with nothing on it."
4,Sini42,"Great editing app, but there is a small bug that's annoying me. When I try to make an effect longer, the app freezes and I have to rejoin the app to continue editing."
5,SJAY4,It just need to have the choice to pick or search your own song and sync in the song with your edit like if u are doing a anime edit
4,ElijahiscoolJK,"I love capcut, I use it for all of my videos on tiktok. But it's missing motion blur. It would help with my videos by making them easier to watch and they would just look smoother."
4,DizNuts 😎👍🏼,"So like it’s good for beginners, I use it because I’m lazy…The storage is really bad! I deleted everything on my phone, and it’s going to tell me to delete more! Can you like fix the problem? Otherwise that, it’s a good editing app! 😎👍🏼"
5,benjamin ho ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ,"Overall the editing app is really good, but can you make it so that you can place infinity overlays? Thats all i want thank you."
4,kentrellswifey,Y’all have a good app but the reason y’all are missing a star is bc every time I try to add effects they don’t really want to work no matter what can u guys check on that and also can u guys add velocity if u know what that means bye thanks CapCut 👍🏽💚
5,lehsia,I got the app and I clicked make a video pretty normal yeah but The option to allow that in my settings for CapCut won’t show up not matter what I do
4,xxwolfiepotato,"I really like the app no watermarks, saving lost photos, multiple layers etc. but I feel like the storage isn’t very great.. don’t get me wrong but I’ve had to re-download to make more videos.."
2,corey2(6,"I used to be able to select where I want my effects to be, and when they happen, but now I can’t. When I try, it just goes to the beginning of the video, and it won’t let me do anything other then delete the effect. Can you please look into this? Thanks!"
5,ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅrobloxinฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ,"I think it should add a update tho, it should have a update to put fire things on you’re overlays, I think it’s a 10/10 for me."
4,Ayme simp,"Honestly a really great app, BUT it would be even better if you guy’s added graphs and maybe some more font options. And if we were able to add more than one animation on a clip the would be perfect"
5,stidkyxyiv,CapCut it’s really good for editing and I use the fonts and I really love this app thank you for making this app and I’m really grateful we’re having this because I am making my gacha intro
5,Nadiah🍪,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP, I would choose this over video star any day! It’s fast, easy, and FREE! I love this app so much, this app is literally everything you could ever need to make the best edits ever."
5,Elizabeth propst,I love it because I can finally. Edit my Gacha club videos now but it would be better if it doesn’t gang up storage quick tho 🥺
4,dabeez7,i like it it’s a good editor app but the only thing I don’t like is when you can’t watch your edits when you don’t have any room in your storage unit and it’s just kind of annoying but overall it’s good
5,tyhbgnfghffn,I have been using this app for about 2 months and I LOVE this app it is so fun to make roblox edits also Anyways this is recommended for anyone who likes to make edits like me This is definitely the BEST editing app that can exist  Bye!
5,animefangirl245,"I hate how in other apps you have logos and have to pay premium to do stuff, but here you dont!"
4,TyeuV,"So this app is pretty good but theres a problom with the words When I leave the video and come back, the word is stick together and take me few minutes to change it back."
5,Aboidr,Hello cap cut this app is so amazing ive been using it for a year but i wish u add more animations in the combo section like the after effects and alight motion edits cuz i rlly need that and cap cut will be better tho💗. Thanks for this amazing app
5,jdhshsushd(dn,can u add more flames and auras around the character in effects? It would really help me edit my videos! And more animations- but other than that the app is really good!
4,rblxbacon_,I love the app but I’m working on an edit that took a long time and it’s saying that I can’t edit it bc it needs an update. But when I press update it doesn’t work no matter how much times I try
5,randomnezz<3,Oml- I love this app so much. The only problem is the velocity aka slow motion. I just want it to be smooth. You know?  Either way. This app is literally the best! Just need help on velocity/ slow motion.
4,Kilani bun,I really love this app but maybe you should add some graphs. I really want people to try on your app with graphs like video Star is hard for them and us videostar people want to help but don’t know how. So please add some graphs. Thank you- from me
4,Shanayouyoute137,"It’s fine especially because it’s free, so you get what you pay for. It is surprising it has many features that are good, could you some more work though on having it not glitch so much."
3,tehdbvd,"This app is amazing on filers, the editing, and anything that you could think of but this app will not let me have more than 4 videos but I don’t know if that’s my phone or what but if you could plz check that out that would be amazing thank you. 😊"
5,you have to change this,But there is one problem multiple people can’t get the new 3D style I have all of the other ones except that one please fix.
5,jojo haha <3,"Everything is actually free! Even no watermark, and so much cool features in the app! This is a very short review. So, if you haven’t downloaded it yet, I recommend you do. It’s a great video editing app!"
4,Bonk3,The app is good it’s 100% AMAZING but the thing is When I started this app it was amazing Now when I try to cut down videos it goes straight down to the begging and I have to use other apps so yes please fix that it’s annoying I cant edit
5,ruvkrav,"I just want to mention that we need an “apply to all” button on this app. When cropping, adding transitions, all that type of stuff. Otherwise great app! Please fix!"
5,Rossyyyy❤️,CapCut is one of the best apps for editing videos! Photos are cool! But I would recommend it more to video editors ! There’s a lot of effects! And everything is free! So if you want a editing app then this is the best app
4,xXhikariXx.,"Ok so overall it’s a great app but for the overlay feature, when I try importing a video it says “couldn’t import. Try again” and no matter how many times I try it doesn’t let me."
5,liza hehehehe,"This app is a great app! But I have a suggestion, there’s an effect called “pulse bars” maybe try making the bars moving as the sound of the video that will be very helpful!!! Good day"
4,Laisha Mae Lazo,I really love capcut! It’s easy to use and has alot of features. But one of my favorite tools called “Styles” has been removed and I’m wondering why? It makes me really sad they removed it I hope they put it back!!
5,Jåckål Åyuzåwå,I couldn't really find any fire affects and that’s the reason I installed it.   But it has a whole lotta other great affects and I really like this app!  But I would really really appreciate it if you put in fire affects!
5,kyiah_1,"Everything is free I like how u can pick any text style, any effects and stuff like that, all ik is that this the best editing it help me a lot with editing and thanks for making this app."
4,S H R X X M I I,"I love this app! I use it to make videos/edits all the time! I use an app called KineMaster, and then I put the vid in CapCut and edit it… but I don’t have a lot of apps or photos, and it says every time “insufficient storage” it’s super annoying. Pls fix it…"
3,collectorkinnie😍,"Love the app and it works great, but the dupe button is gone so I can no longer make edits like I use to, and these little black mark keep forming on any white thing like the eyes of characters. While not a huge deal it kinda ruins the quality of my edits."
4,tmntwins,"I love the app it’s just it always says “ full storage “ when my storage isn’t even full, and I’m always having to delete my edits just to clear up room for this “ full storage “. 😖"
5,Shaught11,"I love this app to make all my edits. It’s very simple once you understand how to add all the cool transitions and stuff. At first I was a little confused, but soon got the hang of it. I definitely recommend!"
4,liyah1024,I love CapCut very much. I use it to make all my edits. I love that you added smoothness for the speed but all my coloring is messed up because of the changes to the adjustment section. I was wondering if there is anything I acanthus do to fix that.
4,zhjsgsjajq,Idk if there’s a way for you to fix the lag because I’m trying to make and video and then I can’t because of the glitching and bugs other then that its an amazing app
5,JEBSISNDVSKDB UGH,"I absolutely love CapCut!! It is such a good editing app, but one thing I would do to help is make it so you can pin something and the screen will follow!!💕 that would be super cool and helpful for all these CapCut users!! :)"
4,meonlyme😍🤞,This app is amazing! Capcut is rlly good for beginners and it’s rlly easy to use. I have no trouble using it. I would just like to recommend you guys adding a smooth slowmo and hd quality. But overall this app is wonderful. Have a good day/night.
4,your sleep pralasis demon,So I got this app and I loved it then it asked me to connect to TikTok so I can use sounds there but here’s the thing every time I go to use them it said no internet but I have full bars and it gets annoying
5,Leggzy,But like imagine not likeing CapCut it’s free ads are often literally everyone uses it and loves it you can make amazing edits put overlays n stuff you don’t even have to convers videos to mp3s CapCut does it for you
5,geforceOptomizer,This editing app is so helpful! It showed me what I can do and it’s very easy unlike other editors in the past. This in general I think I cannot live without this!!
1,hahahahwhhwhahwbwbwb,"I do love this app but I hate when it says storage full, I have to delete my apps but didn’t work,deleted pictures but didn’t work ether, then I deleted capcut didn’t work I hate when it says storage full, pls do something with the storage full thing cause’s it’s getting people mad and don’t want to download I’m not hating just pls fix the storage full problem"
4,chd ST me g ddgh,CapCut is great and all but sometimes I get little glitches in my edits and it’s driving me nuts!! I love to edit and I enjoy when my edit are perfect so I will give this app 4 stars because of the glitches.
5,vsgsjdshdkenzheusn zhddjdbxb,I had capcut for 2 years now and I have bin making many edits for example marvel this helped so much easy free affects and amazing colorings I definitely recommend this app
5,chrispeterward,My review it’s so cool and I can do so much it just makes my day to see cool photos and cool videos there’s so much free stuff and this app is just beyond amazing and well that’s my review of this great app.
4,ezabell villegas,"Capcut is so amazing when i cant edit on video star i go to capcut i love the upgrades you made, there is just one thing that you need, can you please add smooth slowmos and better animations But other then that its amazing."
5,😁😀😃😄😁😆🙂😉,"Bro this is the best editing app ever, I last use kind master  For this you can: -remove water mark at end  -have ton of effects -most likely don’t have to worry of buying something to unlock stuff -green,pink,blue,purple screen basicly do all colors  Can’t: -use some of like text counts (there’s only one cant)  it confusing at first but at some point you will be editing like speed  Please download this app if ur looking threw the reviews"
3,JaydenSxcks,"Hello!, I have been using CapCut since 2020 and I’ve discovered many things about it, but I’m having difficulties. The app is great but i was working on a edit and it didn’t let me add another layer and I kept on refreshing CapCut but it kept deleting my work, please fix CapCut!!"
3,🪦.,"I gave it a 3 bc it’s fun an all and stuff but it deleted all of my hard working stuff, and I was making an edit for a friend and it deleted the edit and I’m frustrated with that bc it’s going to be her birthday gift, and I almost made an edit for myself but it deleted the files"
4,✨🍀💚Lizzy✨,"I loveeee this app! It’s so fun and you can do so much with it! Although..sometimes when I go into photos it says no photos, with I hate hate hate! If you could make that stop that would mean a lot! Thank you!"
4,Pandalover58,"I really love this app but, I had to delete most of my edits and photos because it said “Insufficient storage” and sometimes when im done editing a video it gets really lag so I have to get out of capcut and back in."
5,table1lamp,"I’ve had no prior experience on editing before, I just got this yesterday. I’m really glad I found it, it made editing very simple and easy for me."
5,thjhvfjguuyrti,I love this app its so easy to use and way less confusing than other apps but maybe you guys should add graphs? I feel like that’d be pleasing to a lot of people :))
5,love it toca love love,The problem is that the remove background is not working
4,@sovankaoum,It’s a really good app but I just don’t like the recent update and suchlike. They made the size of the screen even smaller and it’s really frustrating bc it's hard to edit with it and so forth.
4,avegirl56,Ok I love this app because it helps me with gacha vids but when the update came ( a week ago) it said pls update so I did on my video but it said no internet idk why but yea I had to delete it... but I got it again so yea its it is a good app and that’s all! Bye!😊
4,hhdmeksmz,The app is amazing. I use it to edit many vids and it’s my favorite app to use. But however idk what happened but the “remove background” feature used to be good but now it’s horrible. Hope you guys can fix it 🖤💯
3,x nsns,I used the basic effects a lot and it’s stressful that I cannot reverse the effect. When using the cinema closing I have to got to other apps to try and make it an overlay to make it seem as if it’s opening.
2,PuppyDog$1234,I used to use this app for my editing audios but I can’t anymore cos capcut had to add stickers with cussing which I honestly couldn’t care less abt but now because of the stupid restrictions my m0m put on my phone for no reason I can’t have this app anymore. It would be nice if capcut could remove those cause I really like using the app for editing
4,DISGUSTING.....,"do not get me wrong this app is amazing but the thing is that there isn’t much transitions. What I mean by that is the transitions are very boring, same with the filters. Maybe add more effects with more creativity? There’s no creativity put into it."
1,&(8&&(&84(8=4(3&,I used to be able to make and save videos but now I can’t even make videos anymore :( it says to go to settings to enable make and save videos but it shows me Siri & search and notification but overall the app is great when I used to be able to use it but for some reason I can’t enable it because it doesn’t show me the button
3,Cari2!!,Can you guys please add text effects like vita with the subtitles and can you guys also have it where we make an account so if we accidentally deleted CapCut we could still have our saved projects thank you.
4,yf G,I’ve had this app for a while and I really like it but I don’t like the new update. Whenever I try to split the video the app splits it longer and I don’t want it to do that. Also the slowmo is choppy and makes my videos look bad.
4,nabigaxha,I like using CapCut for edits and stuff..it’s a very simple app! I like how the watermark is also optional. My only problem is that I don’t always have the bar at the bottom for templetes- I’ll have to redownload the app if I want the update.
4,Helen Rblx,"Ok so i have been using this app for a long time and its great!  its just that I can’t add effects anymore for some reason, its just that when i press the check it wouldn’t let me add the effects for some reason."
4,Shamiah Pinkston,so is it just mine lagging or ?? Another day I made a review about lagging on CapCut the lagging stopped for about a day today I was trying to make it early and I couldn’t because of the lagging this is either my 3 or 4th time making a review
5,jaelynlovesdogs,Or I have to admit this is a good app to do vid like I do funny ones for my friends but the problem is it takes up so much space and I have to doesn’t and get it back
4,✨💜BTSxARMY💜✨,I love it very much....But one problem when I tried to save my edit that took me 3 days it kicks me out of the app while saving the video I try a lot but it still kicks me out...why does it not let me save my edit?
5,Jennisa welson,When I first installed it I was using it And it would lag alot that's my Only Problem it's awsome but I recommend to add more editing Cubes
4,krifjtjt,"But they should let us do are own transitions and more , but I love it! And why it dosen’t let me use overlay and text, why? Like I want to make edits but I can’t Bc it do set let me use text and overlay  And that’s why I give it a four so yeh but anything else I love it!"
5,adventures with natalia,This is free and amazing. Cause there is a watermark but but at the end of your edit. To get rid of the watermark you trim the video after saved.l think you should download this.
5,Domenic R-S,Is it just me or is it that when you save a photo to your album does it show the picture cause like I can’t see it :(
4,Thatgirlmakaylasksksk,"So first I just wanna say it’s a really great app! But when I would watch my video it would pause and keep pausing then it wouldn’t let me download stuff to my phone! And yes, my storage is great! So overall...it’s just..idek😒"
5,Tishy4,"I love this so much more than others, the only problem was you can only add a certain amount of overlays. Otherwise it’s the best editing app"
5,Latoyia1,Anyone else experienced a severe slow down in the app? This is one of my favorites so can someone tell me if any update is coming soon? Thanks! Really really love this app!
5,amberxlautejj,This app is literally the best but when I edit I’m trying to find the best so I like if y’all make the sound play while yu move it around it will really help🙃🙏🏽 but so far the best🔥🔥
4,goldy pig,When I want to do a edit sometimes I put like football players but when I click remove background I dosent just remove the background but I removes half of his hair
4,fun gand,This is an amazing app it is really easy to use and amazing at editing as I was a beginner it is easy to use and I request to add the style back please and thank you.
4,Kailin NoneOfYourBusiness ;),"I overall like the app. It’s easy to use and there’s a lot of transitions. My question is, why did you guys remove auto velocity? It’s no longer there. I used it and I liked it. Please add it back."
5,thedaycarekids,So I have one thing to ask…can you plzzzzzzzzz let us use the freaking smooth better quality with reverse to I beg y’all to fix it!!
3,equine gal01,ok so when i first started i loved it but then i got more advanced and i still love it butttttttt y’all removed style from the thing😑 i used that so many times because i was looking for a certain thing and i would find it there. PLEASE BRING IT BACK AND I DONT WANT IT BACK IN A MONTH I WANT IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
5,Bdbsnsbshbsha,just got it and its already amazing. Very simple to use plus has lots of options to make edits. Also its free which is even better
4,puddabutt,"I would really like this update, because the sounds are filling up my storage and I can’t delete them. So could you please make a update for this?"
5,H2kasba,"I 100% recommend it. It’s so fun and cool and easy to use. You can’t prove me wrong, I’m more of an audio editor than a video editor and all my music turns out amazing. The best part is…. ITS TOTALLY FREE"
5,bestayyMelodyシ,"It’s pretty good and the best thing is it’s free!!, I have a request to make your app better!! You can add a auto beat velocity like that would be SOO cool!!"
5,jdjsjjsjsjaja,I happen to be an editor and usually I use video star until I came across capcut and there new updates are a 10/10!!
5,Leah Riebe,i really like this app not only you don’t need a subscription but it’s also really easy to use i wanted an app like this right here! overall this app is amazing
5,catrocks112,I make all my edits and it’s very simple when u get used to it! I think u can do pretty much everything and a lot of it doesn’t cost money!
5,Beli🥰🦄,"This app is the best. You don’t need to pay for anything! It has so many options, and is getting better and better! Recommended!"
5,Bl00dy..Crybabys..girls,The reason why it’s good for beginners is because it’s really to use and has good animations it’s amazing it’s not hard like video Star or stuff like that CapCut Is easier to use.
5,hassan_EnKuT,"When we write down a text on either photo or video in Arabic letter, it can’t write from right to left."
5,sksisjeis,So this app is very very nice for beginners that don’t know how to edit and stuff because CapCut is a really easy app for beginners so I really recommend this app for being a beginner
5,yesssssss27362827367272627272,I use this for all my Gacha edits it’s so good great quality and great for anything and anyone and best part ITS FREE every thing is free also get it NOW or I will come to your house at 3AM and tickle you feet because I’m a sissy Baka😈

5,Yubelkiss,It won’t let me download it and its not because storage I dont understand that has happened
5,boiiiiiiiiiiioiiii,I love CapCut! It’s an awesome app but I do have one problem. When I open photos I have HUNDREDS but it says I have none it very weird and so is writing the end of reviews
5,Chompy YT,Very easy to use let’s you preview the fax and you don’t have to install new audio. There is also no watermarks on the vids so all of it is a W
5,GabI14reset,CapCut is so good in editing anything I would really recommend it if you can’t edit in any app it’s hard at first but then it will be very easy
3,Mgsweetplays,It’s a pretty good editing app but what’s really annoying is when your trying to click on a tiny picture or photo and it doesn’t let you it’s really annoying and CapCut needs to fix that but otherwise it ok.
5,bskaksbhcisksndjdjs,Fix the could not import thing or u will spam fake things about you and make you look bad
3,navy.editz,say you put a audio of vocals and an audio of the instrumental and go head about a minute. the audios get delayed and even when you go out of the project and back in and go up ahead it still gets delayed. PLEASE fix this
1,why me i hate this app,I hate this app so much I try to open a project so I can save it and when I hit the save button it said clear up storage when I only had that one project so I deleted the app and I downloaded it again and when I click the plus it said clear up more storage when I didn’t even make any projects yet this app is so stupid don’t download it.
4,Simp<333,"I love the app yes, but it keeps saying my storage is full when I wanna keep editing, I delete and delete things but it still doesn’t work. But other than that the app is great, especially for beginners like me."
4,hfrybvfh,Hello CapCut is a very good app I’ve made a lot of things on it for my animation but now for some reason it won’t let me adjust the speed and I don’t know why it let me before now it won’t
5,BaconBoy(Blinded Action),This has surprisingly helped me make my videos lately…. And I’m happy that this app was able to be real and You should download this app.
5,Izzy afton,I love this app I can make so Many videos but when I made a long video it kind of glitches so I suggest you should fix that bug thank you😁
5,Barnie the Din0,I have to thank the creators of this app I mean everything I need is accessible for video editing and it’s a big convenience to not have to pay for stupid little things. Love this app🔥😁👍 NO LIKE FR FR LIKE PLEASE DONT CHANGE IT😰
4,choco bars,It’s a great app if you’re starting anime edits. It really helped me! But today when I was working on Capcut. Capcut deleted everything i worked on. I would really appreciate if someone explained what happened
5,brey_458,This app is absolutely amazing! U need to download this app! You can do so many things with text and stuff it’s just so good!
3,BlakieThakur,"Good app and has been using it for a while. But the latest version 4.0 no longer provide “reducing noise” feature, which is a disappointment. I’ll try some other video editing apps instead."
4,hdhydhfhfn,I love this app it’s animations ‘ effects and everything expect the fact that the app is very glitchy besides that it’s really good for starters and has a lot of effects I do recommend it
5,"""FilthyLittleMudblood""",Capcut is an amazing app but while im in the middle of editing it says “no internet connection. Connect to your internet” but I AM CONNECTED TO MY INTERNET. I Don’t know if this is a bug or not but i still love this app
5,keydere,"Overall I love the app and the fact that is free! But I would love if you guys could add more variety when it comes to transitions. Other than that, I love the app so far!"
5,Frog. :),"It’s very easy and good for starters! The effects are nice aswell. CapCut was a big start for me about editing and how to make it good, now I’m starting to get better. I’m so glad this app was here! I love the effects btw <3"
4,ansssssd,"It’s great and I love the features but when I put in a screenshot it does not work properly, could you add a feature to make all the screen shots fit the screen without doing it manually?"
5,amits_1177,"Effects, effects, effects! There are so many effects! It’s easy to use, with lots of features and tools, I highly recommend this app to everyone:)"
4,Maralun,So this is a great edit app! But it always says not enough storage an I always rage! So I deleted it and downloaded it back! But the button it says it’s loading liek I cant download it. Not like when the game is almost done downloading. It’s not cool :(

4,Slow the effects,I wish they could make it to where you can slow the effects while the video stays the same speed
3,Magician6,I like to use this but it is so annoying when I’m trying to make an edit and I click the picture and it sends me to the filter mode and i am so annoyed I think that it can do better but other then that it’s fine
5,𝙴,I use this app all the time for edits I make for tiktoks. It is completely free and the quality is amazing. I use this app to edit my Kpop edits for my followers. I have seen many people use it and love it!
5,jayyhissssmammmmmmsbs,"I make videos and I love using this app! There is no watermark, the effects and transitions are so good, and more! By far the best editing app that I love! You did amazing making this app"
4,I love capcut,Capcut is awesome but one thing I think you could make a account so all you have to do is sign in so if you accidentally delete the app you can keep your edits.
5,Zackracer10,"This is the best app I've used for editing! No watermark, it gives you the option to remove the last watermark, would recommend to any friend."
5,hotmanass36ssister,"this is the BEST app i used for editing videos, hands down. no ads, everythings free, and you can remove the watermark aswell, not to mention how easy it is to edit. im sharing this w my friends defo."

5,Cokie_moon230,I use it for my gacha and anime edits but this is great for all of those I need them to get all stars I love it I would definitely recommend for editors!

3,rdsyyhzufxiyds,Hi so I have been using CapCut for a very long time but the quality of the video was perfectly fine but now the quality is terrible you can’t see a thing please fix this
1,fnaf security breach,So I do gotcha life and whenever I will try to get my sounds from TikTok it would either say no Internet connection or you have no favorite to sound and so I would go onto my TikTok and I could clearly see I had a lot of favorite sounds and I kept on saying you have no favorites so I will delete the app and re-download it and it would be the same thing.
5,Anyways~ RES,I think you should upgrade because when I sign in my tiktok It works for the sounds.. But a day later it says “Disconnection” I refreshed it and it soesnt work
5,zebolean,I love this app but like the “ no internet connection please try again later” on the sounds tab for tiktok can be fixed please thank you
4,Oakxlie•,"4 stars its good and all but when you rotate stuff it gets smaller and it’s annoying there should be a button to change that, also add velocity!"
4,djjgvnnk,i love capcut so much but y’all need to add graphs and smooth slow mo😪 also my phone doesn’t let me import fonts so i don’t know if that’s my phone’s problem or if it was set that way. Everything else is amazing otherwise!
3,DerRoc,I tried making something and it didn’t move so I tried again and once it moved it randomly went out of place when I didn’t touch it! Please fix it! (Imma change it to 3 stars instead of 2)
4,Shyanne-672,So this app is so good and the update is also good but I only want on thing… Graphs and custom effects and shake animations and more. You can if u want but I want capcut so kinda be like alight motion but without the water mark and free If I can then this would be great😎

3,bites lip,I was just editing fine for about 7 months then all of a sudden when I put on a transparent over lay  it’s has a white background!!! I tried deleting and reinstalling witch deletes all my unfinished work in the process but still doesn’t work :(
5,Idkidc:/,It’s so easy for me to figure out and I can edit videos and everyone has been asking me how I did it
5,katiemarshmallowscak,"Ok so I love this app! But why do you keep removing sounds? I needed one in horror and now it’s gone, and when I was about to reset my key board history because I was playing CAPCUT WAS UNINSTALLED AND MY VIDEOS WERE GONE AND I WORKED HARD ON THOSE!! 😭😭😭😭"

4,costomenra jdl,"If your ever looking for a great editing app to help cut, edit, and advance your videos capcut is the app for you. It has amazing filters and overlays you can do and there’s so much to explore. Overall capcut is the top recommendation for an editing app!"
1,Gen smith,It’s fine but after once in a while it won’t let you do any of them and sometimes you have to delete the app that has over 200 edits on it that happened to me and I lost all these important edits and now it won’t let me edit on it which is really annoying so please reach out and see if you have the same problem!
4,Milk Tea wirh,I have to be honest! This is the best app I used to edit videos but there is a problem with it. It takes to much storage and I have to keep downloading and deleting it.
5,9/11 is a holiday,I want to make videos but it says storage full storage full this app is good but it’s annoying when i can’t make videos

2,rockstarshar80s,"For the past few weeks, when trying to add effects, it won’t add them and the videos are lagging really bad when I play them in the app. I used to never have problems but here lately it is just terrible. What good is a editing app when you can’t add anything? Please fix!"
5,Ninijr314,I had seen my friends making edits with this so I decided to try this and make a AOT edit it’s really easy to use for a beginner or experienced person!
4,Madeline1357,Love this app it’s so great for making videos and edits and it’s 100% free and i’ve been using it for about a month but recently it’s been glitching out like crazy and randomly closing out the app
3,isaac dasilva,I clear out my storage and it says I don’t have enough storage even tho I cleared it out it’s making me delete games just to edit but overall the editing is very good in the app but if I have enough storage just let me edit?!
4,isuckbigtoes101,It’s a great app it is but I don’t like how it always says my storage is full when half of my camera roll is gone an if I try to add old videos it takes a long time or just says sorry can’t add

5,Qwdfvgfcscdf,So I just downloaded it like few minutes ago cause my friend told me to get it to make tiktoks and stuff so I did and I have been using it and it’s amazing.
2,Nopeeeeeerz,"There are a bunch of cool effects that I like on here but are a lot of things I don’t like. No matter how long and meticulous I take making an edit, videos come out delayed. And it’s hard to get effect and text sliders lined up. I only use it because it’s free and the most mentioned one I see on tik Tok."
5,aidenisrad123,This is one of my favorite editing apps! I’ve used it so much by now. I’ve made many hilarious and cool videos. Thank you for making such a wonderful app!
5,Olivia Gagne,I just got this app yesterday and im surprised that everything is literally free plus great quality. This is definitely one of the best editing apps out there.
4,gygubhhun,I love it and I had so much fun editing but one day my CapCut just reset and all my progress and edits that I work so hard on we’re all gone I got so upset because all my hard work was gone
4,missgurlreviews,I use the app and it’s honestly amazing but there is some lag wether it’s turning down the opacity or playing a non laggy video that now has lag. This app would be a 5/5 if there wasn’t any lag
5,RobinMB21,So I swear this app is the best editing app ever but ever since yesterday I couldn’t make an edit or add things to a edit can you please reply to this to awnser my question? 🌸🤩 ty!
4,capxut,It’s not that great and also when I try to do something it won’t let me cause apparently “my storage is too full” even if I delete things it don’t work
5,Keanu Reeeves,I would like to see a option to edit speed of tracks and audio with options between 0.9-1.0 etc for example 0.91 or 0.92
4,supr stuf,I love capcut for my gacha channel gacha Alana BUT. I really need the music to stop when the video ends plus I need faster transition maybe you already did that since i didn’t update it yet. It’s a great app tho 😃
5,cowboygiraffe4life,"Why is nobody talking about this app?!?!?!!?!!?! ITS GREAT😂 I was looking for an editing app for my yt channel that was free and didn’t have a watermark and... I FOUND THIS GOLDMINE😭✋ it is so amazing. If I was being picky lol, i wish there was a voiceover option—BUT. That’s the only thing wrong😂😂 LOVE ITTTT"

5,!!!!! fix this!!!!!,"I love this app! It’s the best editing app I have ever had!!! It’s free, has no adds, and when I save a video it’s fast and easy! I love it and there is nothing that I think should change."
3,wordy wprd wotd word,"So I love this app and I use it a lot but I have one problem with it, when I try to edit my photos I’ll make something I really like but then it turns it into a video instead of a photo so then I can’t use it for a photo."
3,blowpop:):),it’s a great app! Don’t get me wrong there’s no water mark and a lot of free things for beginners but there’s some things that are annoying. For instance when it says I have to many layers 😐.i hate when that happens but overall great app
3,_neccowafer_,"This app is amazing! The best free video editing app there is out there. But I’ve made 3, 20 second edits and it’s taken up 2 GB of space. Please fix this. My device dosent have that much space. And I’ve been forced to delete lots of other things just to make space for this app 😐"
4,Daisyflowefpretty,"This app is a pretty nice app, but Rn its got a problem, whenever I’m in the app and I watch the video I do, it’s completely on beat but when I take it out of editing and finish it, it’s not on-beat in my camera roll"
4,Drppinq,"I personally just wish you could add photos/videos while you’re editing (unless there is a feature that allows you to do so, but I haven’t found yet), but it’s a great app!"
4,imatruepersonbtw,I love this app I use it multiple times a day but the only reason why I am giving it a four is because beware it can get a little confusing. But I recommend it. It’s just amazing
4,Emma.M321,I love this app! Been using to make edits. But lately some of the features don’t work because it says that I’m not connected to the internet which is not true... hope you fix this

3,babyagirl,I can’t crop how and I want and it’s annoying. You need to come up with a better way to crop. For example have the cropping lines Olin the picture or video you click so it’s easier. I am thoroughly disappointed in this app
4,sophialeeishonestlythebest,CapCut is a good app for beginners and once after a year or two it started to lag and take an hour for my 5 sec projects to download and it just stops working sometimes
5,Enanuelle,"This is the best editing app I have used by far. There are a ton of features to use for editing, and everything is free. I highly recommend this app."
5,SanicMLG NOSCOPER!,"This has to be the best video editor app on iOS  Not to mention that it’s all free. All of it, most of the paid ones don’t have the power this one does!"

1,T Law Firm,"The app is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese owned company based out of Beijing.  This means the Chinese communist government has access to app and any data they collect. When you give ByteDance access to you photos, videos, and mic, you are also giving their communist government access to all of you photos and videos.    The app is basically a data collection tool for the Chinese communist government."
5,ekekxk,"This editing app is SO GOOD, it has amazing features and high quality editing tools I highly recommend it  I use it to edit my vids and it turns out AMAZING. If u need a good editing app download this app RIGHT NOW  I promise u will not regret it U can add music or add in audio of ur own  Edit clips or videos and has special affects u can do   So overall 5 out of 5 stars ⭐️  Really good app, amazing high quality and perfect 👌 for editing"
2,INeverReviewAnyth1ng,I can’t play my videos while editing them without insane lag. I can’t edit what I can’t see. PLEASE FIX THIS! I’ve cleared the majority of my drafts and cleared cache and nothing has helped. I’ve been using this app for about a year now and these problems are recent. Otherwise an all around great app to use.
5,:) :D :B :P,I love that this has all the features that any other editing app would have but unlike them it’s free!😁
5,gamer gummy,A lot of people are mad that you can’t screen record it’s literally on settings my friend showed me the editing app and it’s really good

4,Ameirria,"CapCut is a great app but it has some bugs like I try to import a overlay but it says “couldn’t import, try again later” and it only says that for certain videos I have no idea why."
1,lakinganae king,So I wanted to edit my TikToks and I went to the App Store and I put in editing app for TikTok and I saw Capcut at first I was happy so I download it and it got done loading and then I went on it and I went to edit my things but the thing wouldn’t let me do anything because all the stickers was trash and I wanted the editing app like the other people on Tiktok edit and it just was not amazing
1,KittenGirlXOXO😻😻😻😻,"Hello thanks for taking your time to read this. Honestly this is very glichy. It skips photos and transformations, please fix this. I have deleted this app once, I’m about to give it a 2 try and if I delete this again that means this problem is still going on and on. So when I try this for the 3rd time please fix this,  Thanks for you attention."

5,softie mango,I personally love cap cut it’s free and it’s cute and the translation and I love doing Roblox edits and editing my video on here such amazing keep doing what your doing I think it’s perfect no improvement from me :)
3,AcidSprite,I spent maybe a good hour editing a video then i saved it and I went to go watch the video back and CapCut rearranged all the footage around which is very frustrating. Then I had to go back and edit the video all over again.
4,moonVib3s,This app is great and all but it says to free some storage so I did and it keeped on saying that even though I already freed up storage so if you could fix that I would be appreciat it!
3,wallacexrawz,I love using it for different edits  but now it says to give it access to albums of saving and editing photos I tried but I don’t know where it is on the options app so I gave up and didn’t use it for like 1 hour
5,crystisol,It is a very good app the only  thing is that I cannot put more than one pic in the same pic I know it will sound weird but it is so good the app ❤️🥵
5,Noras rew,This app is ssooooo easy to use and it used to take me 30 minutes to make videos now it takes me me under 10 minutes. :)

4,Ms Ruckus,"I love it very much and it’s really easy to use, it’s just its very glitchy for my stickers and I can’t even open some of my projects, I love it but if you can work on the glitches I would be very happy!"
4,✨ T a u r u s✨,So whenever I tried putting it in slow-mo on the speed it was laggy I tried to make a trend of something but then it was laggy.
4,this is my 11th attempt,"I use CapCut a lot and I know it’s  not my internet, it always lags if you slow down a overlay video for me. Other than that it’s amazing. But it gets REALLY annoying when it lags."

4,emmaemmmaemammaas,"Honestly, this app is very nice. Sometimes it’s very hard to navigate though. Also, half of my tik tok sounds aren’t downloading and I’ve heard other people say the same but overall, it’s a nice app."
3,Polrd56,The app is amazing trust me I enjoy it and it’s easy to use but it keeps saying I’m not connected when I’m actually connected please fix it because it kinda ruins the experience I’ve tried everything and I can’t use it.
5,SoosMain,I’ve been looking for the perfect editing app for so long and I have finally found it! This app has so many affects for free! Best editing app ever
2,jeliana sjantelle,Now there is green glitches when I edit and make velocity’s and it’s very annoying and the smooth slow motion doesn’t work anymore and the video actually becomes more laggy when I add smooth slow motion so please may I ask nicely to fix this bug!
4,bruhemo,Great app indeed but I'm wondering why my style button is gone now I can't use auto velocity for my edits. Where did it go? And why was it deleted/removed?
3,goatsta_,"Anybody else chat has gotten bigger on already edited videos? and some words, specifically words with apostrophes are tripled spaced although there’s no space at all. This all started happening when you guys released the update."
5,nunuu reviews,Please give back
4,im demi lavoto,"So, the app is pretty cool like I mean I watched a lot of yt vids and yk I’m like I wanna edit so like yk I get the app and it’s been going really good. But maybe just probably if u can add audio text to songs, that would help me a lot! Thanks bye!"

4,why i like fortnite,Its a good and helpful app just if your on pc and cant find a editing software/app its stressful it would be really helpful to add it on pc like maybe Microsoft store? I would love that other then that its a very helpful app!
4,poopoo_licker,"Good app but I don’t have access to 90% of the effects and new updates even though I update it often, please help me or fix this I don’t have any of the new effects they added."
4,pershette,Can you make it so you can like edit the speed for a example: you can like chance the speed of how long you want it to last
5,Rose Bumanglag,Been on a hunt for a great editor and this is just it. It’s got all the features I have been looking for!!! The best part?? IT’S FREE!!! You can’t go wrong!
2,kittykibbles,"Was excited to start using this software to make my animation/gifs instead of my outdated sucky software I had been using, only to find I can’t make GIFs using this app and also can’t even make a very short, looping video (less than 10 seconds) <//3 sad to say I won’t be using this"
4,Needs big fixes!!!!!!,Best app I’ve used to edit Tiktok’s however there’s a bug that shows no internet connection when trying to use favorite sounds so I currently can’t use the app.
4,Caturn14,"i really really like this app. it’s a great place to start editing, or just to edit on in general! i was amazed that it was completely free because it offers so much. there are some things or animations i wish we could see, like a fish-eye zoom out or a time slicer with color shift - kinda just video star or after effects-like transitions -  but overall i’d definitely recommend this platform! free and super easy and beginner friendly!"
4,buggygurl,Don’t get me wrong I love CapCut but it’s annoying to do the graphs I added key frames and transitions and it’s still not letting me do it owners of Cap cut please fix it so I don’t have to do this every time I try to do one.
4,suppertastic,"Every time I use keynotes, they move in their own! Is this supposed to happen? It really annoys me because even when I stop touching it, the keynote picture still moves"
5,Kayla andrade mendez,"I’ve been using CapCut for a while, and it is by far the best I’ve seen. It is free, and everything is so simple and easy to do! 10/10, this is great."
4,TJEditz,"I’ve been using this app and most of my edits would have one problem, bad slow-mos. All I want are smooth slow-mos and maybe a velocity category?"
5,queenbossem,I love y’all so much likeee😩😩😩y’all literally got everything I need! in one place!!! Like😩😩😩❤️❤️❤️❣️❣️❣️❣️yall perfect the way y’all is for real please don’t change nothing about this app it’s absolutely perfect 😩❤️❣️💯y’all a blessing
4,mimisbutterflys,"I love this app! Once you get the hang of it there’s amazing things you can do! Though, there’s some things I wish were better though, for example the slowmo is not so good. Also PLEASE ADD GRAPHS"
4,XxCookie LunaXx,I love the app so so much but what makes me mad is I jade to delete like almost every app that’s important and when I’m done using cap it I delete it and download the others back :[
5,lucifersobsession,I love everything about this app but I do have a recommendation that will definitely satisfy us all! you guys should add a motion blur transition option like video star has.
4,theebigsteppa,"Easy to use, but it’s just so laggy. When you export a video it’s fine, but it’s impossible to edit when it lags while doing the actual editing…  Pls fix it"
5,big noob hehhehe,its an amazing app for beginners once you get the hang of it you can make magic out of it ive moved on from the app but i still use it from time to time :D
5,lindsay stokes,I ABSOULUTELY LOVE THIS APP!!  I USE IT SO MUCH AND I LOVE HOW THEY DONT FORCE YOU TO HAVE A WATERMARK OR ANYTHUNG!! i try to ALWAYS remember to give capcut credit (there will be sometimes where i forget) but i just always give capcut credit bc I LOVEEEEEE THIS APP and basically everything’s FREE likeeee YES JUST YES 10/10 would recommend
5,softy_fz,"I like using this app because it’s easy and free to edit videos. But when I save it, it lowers the quality but still good to make velocity edits and more."
4,reichenbachfalls,"I’d like if we were able to upload our own fonts, it would help because i just love the text animations and I’d love to see them with newer fonts. Other than that, I love this app!"
3,thecildofmymom,"It’s good but it will only let me share to tic tok . Other wise it’s perfect, I just wish could upload it on facebook or Twitter. But as I said other wise an amazing editing app. It’s very simple to use. It has preset music you can use, simple controls, and amazing animations."
4,80adrii,I love CapCut a lot it’s a good app but I wish they could make the speed smoother and the blur with more speed and other animations for the texts and new texts styles other than that it’s a great app!
4,Evade Rexxx,We should be able to crop a certain part of a video  like in alight motion we should be able to mask and green screen a certain part of a video
4,obbyonecanobe,"I spent two days on an edit and it’s not even letting me save it, I tried clearing up my storage and updating the app but it keeps closing every time I try to save it. Please fix this ASAP."
2,himsjhdjs,"Why do I have to pay to get this back, also whenever my ‘ storage ’ is ‘ full ‘ I delete some old photos like a lot of them and it still says it’s full like 😐, I also delete the app because it resets the storage but now I have to pay to get it back 😕. That’s stupid. It was fun while it lasted."
4,Abbyjaby,So this is a amazing app but you can’t search up for your own Music which is sad because I need them song called bad child for my gachas
3,Annalovesfries123456,"Don’t get me wrong I love CapCut and I use it for everything but when I was animating the app didn’t have enough overlay spaces for all of the parts I needed to animate my character. It really disappointed me as I took all morning planning the animation please fix this. Sincerely, Sad Animator"
5,❤️Lizzie❤️,I love this app because I'm a gacha life/gacha club person and I love how the app was made so I can do lots of things I love this app so much but I whish it will add some more music that is popular right now
5,GachaKitten23,When I first saw this I thought it was TRASH. But most things are for free omg I’m so happy! Thank you so much it doesn’t crash and it’s soooo freaking FREEEEEE the no watermark thing is an awesome touch it makes me feel so free! 😎
5,stawberry_shortcake,This app is amazing I use it for Roblox and Gacha so it way better cute cute and kinemaster my opinion CapCut is beautiful I got my cousin in to it and she likes it and she edit amazing was this app and she just got it
5,essmce,"CapCut is amazing it has great potential and features, maybe if you can add a little bit more of animation would be great but I rate it a 10/10 a good app maybe the best out there"
5,jimjank,"I have used this app for so long and it looks pretty professional! I would like if there were more animations and more transitions. But overall, this app is great!"
5,tonysimp927,"I love this app so much, it has a lot of options and they are all free, no watermark. Most apps make you pay for half of the effects but not this one!"
5,Your local Manger,Y’all should totally adds graphs and motion blur for those who want to really start editing it would be great also add my overlay space would be great!
5,UnicornLover:),"I’ve been searching for a free app to make my edits with and I finally found the perfect one, I now use this app to edit all of my videos and I love it so much!😁"
1,isane wolf dragon,Ok so I loved it but I had to delete it bc it to way to much Storage up and I had to delete all my apps just so I could use it so know I don’t have anyth8ng to do when I’m boarded and I really hate the app now so if you could make this again but with less Storage use then that would be awesome but I really hate how all my apps are gone know just bc of this appp and I hate this
4,Izzie_cookie,"I’ve had CapCut for awhile and it was pretty good until, I couldn’t press any of the buttons on the bottom of the screen. I deleted the app and reinstalled it and it still didn’t work."
5,CBES112233,"This app is extremely simple and doesn’t take much effort to make a single edit, which I love. I have nothing more to say I just gonna clarify in my opinion this app is amazing."
5,itsbabyolive,this app is amazing i use this for anime edits or to make a amv there is nothing i can complain about with this app and my videos come out looking as i imagined everything is so easy to use and you can also use music from a video in your camera roll only thing might be is... could we get an animation or effect that that moves an image or picture like water in a way
5,That small one,To edit the volume is super hard. It would be nice to type the volume instead
4,hosseinhekmat,Why the options failed and the message that you are not connected to the Internet
3,Kelłíe,"So.. I like this app a lot but there is one problem.. When your trying to add more photos, some of your photos you have aren't showing and won't show unless you delete some of your photos that are showing. It's stressing me out"
5,justcallmelucky ._.,I’m so happy downloaded this app. It’s really great maybe even greater than KineMaster or PowerDirector. There’s no adds and no watermark. That’s all I can say. I hope I don’t sound like a bot😅
5,phøbøs,"This app is amazing. it’s has so many options, all for free. it is one of the best finds ever, and i really love this app! 11/10 could not ask for better."
5,Yousif13927,This app is way better than all the other editing apps out there and it’s completely free which is amazing and it really helped me out!
4,nobody ya,This app is amazing I’ve been using imovie for so long until I found this app and it’s way better. They have so many cool affects to add every small detail. It makes my videos look like I’m a pro editor. It’s amazing!!!!!.(And it’s free!)
5,michael_inocencio,this app is absolutely amazing ! Period. Perfect transitions & effects with like actually so many filters and straight up everything you need for a music video!
4,Mango_Manger on yt,So I like using this for roblox edits but now there is a glitch where the styles icon is gone i really need that fixed or I won’t be able to use velocity anymore.
5,uffjussgjud,Usually apps like these make you pay for everything but this is the best thing ever and honestly it is way better then other edit apps
5,Handsome Youth!,"I'm not a pro but I can already tell that this app is awesome.  I literally tried the transitions from pic to pic and had to go rate the app.  For anyone looking to spice up their shots, this is the app to use."
5,say divisive,The app is amazing but I wish it would be easier to use at first but other than that it was amazing i love the app so…  Oh yea it gave me a few troubles but it’s okay
4,pooooop i hate u777,"This app is actually decent for editing. But there used to be a ""Style"" Option with Velocity on it and more. It's gone now, is it just me or everyone else too? I don't have it, Please add it back."
3,tomhollon,… I’m very angry about CapCut deleting the style button every one I was making amazing edits I want CapCut to bring it back!!! Especially the velocity button it made it very easy for beginners and people that have a hard time with making velocity 😕 I want it BACK!!!!!!!!😭
4,FREEDOMDARKBENDY,Ok I really love this but I have one request for developers can ur make templates feature turnable because I have trouble with export button top right corner anyways I hope this gets accepted
3,zoaysav,The style option doesn’t work. It’s upsetting to see that I only have three options and none of them work. Other than that the editor is fine for basic editing.
4,willowwwLOL,"i’ve been using this game for almost a year now and everything is very good so far the issue is just that every time i try to make videos on it and i make like 3 or 2 out of no where, where i hit the video(s) i’ve been working on it says “out of storage” but i only have a bit of videos the amount of videos i have is 5 because of the others i deleted so please tell me how to solve it. thank u"
5,xoxoevelyn@yt,I love all of the effects and it is so fun to play around with! and there is new updates pretty much every other day!
1,jfjfjfjfjcjrjdjdjdjdkfk,I spent a couple hours on an edit that I wasn’t finished with and I accidentally clicked off of it now the only option I have is to delete the edit or just keep it there and when I try to tap it it says something about my space being to low honestly so sad this happend it was getting pretty good and I spent so long on it
5,•𝕮𝖆𝖗𝖎∙,I really love this app but i have a question for you guys is it ok if you guys change velocity so that when we add it. It syncs in with the beat we are using?
4,your fav porn starr,Cap cut is a great app for beginners but it needs more sounds to use I have to switch over to other apps that are paid when I want to use certain sounds
4,plsuse30,Everyone is posting on tiktok this auto velocity but I don’t have it. I have updated my Snapchat I gone through every single button and I can not find it.
5,pok3monf4n,This app is good I'll give it a 5 star rating but I just noticed ur app is having audio delay and I don't like audio delay so please fix the audio delay
5,Tony Lee Scott,Thank you for making a high quality app that is also FREE I have been editing with CapCut and u are a star! 100% recommend
5,chip the pimp named slickback,When i save my video it always has bad quality-
4,socialgguk,I love this app DEARLY !! I use graphs allot for my videos but recently the graphs have been sorta (??) glitching !! And doing the opposite of what they are supposed to be used for. This is really annoying. Could this be fixed ??
4,zpubs,I give it 4 stars I mean it’s easy to use but after you login for musics with tiktok after a day it’ll say “unavailable reconnect to WiFi” even while being connected
5,のてゃっryであn,"I dabble in editing in my free time on the occasion, and this is by far no contest the best free app that is easy to use with a wide range of options. Thank you developers I love this app!"
4,Snowy_cloud8,"So this app is very confusing at first, I haven’t even completely gotten the hang of it yet! Idk if it’s great for beginners since I am one but it is very fun once you get good at it- my friends and youtubers tell me that. Have a good day/night! <3 🤩"
4,E̾m̾i̾l̾i̾a̾n̾o̾,But I had it no more storage and I deleted a lot of apps and I could’ve only added one video and everything to get about the app but you must have a lot of storage ☺️
5,Elmax2006,It’s a really good app but it’s corny and hard to edit at the same time but u really have to know how to edit Bc cc is good u just have to knows how to use
5,∂ι¢кѕαυѕє,"CapCut is probably one of the absolute best free editors. CapCut is very easy to use, and doesn’t have ads. I have made many awesome videos with CapCut and highly recommend it."
5,loveiswanted,I LOVE the app but can you guys make an update where you add a search bar for the effects because I don’t like spending 4 hrs scrolling for the effects :( .
3,Isabella0421.,Hi as a small CapCut editor I recommend that you guys add smooth velocity because that is something that I struggle to do on CapCut also have better quality and more filters that’s we can fade out and more than one animation per Clip or text thank you :)
4,Divineonxb0x,I love the app it’s just that sometimes when you have a clip it will start lagging and then when you have text they will disappear out of no where
5,Marilyn Thomas,It keeps telling me that it requires access to album for saving and editing videos
5,XxxDeadshotxx86,Can y’all add the option to save a custom curve because it’s tiring doing the same thing over and over again
5,AC loves G,I wish you could search songs and they would have popular songs.
5,Craycray Bai,It’s a very good app and super easy to use. I use it a lot for my yt channel. But can you update it to the newest emojis?! They don’t even have 🥶jut to name one. PLEASE update ASAP
5,Dashingruslanchik1,can you add the effects like pinch and expand in retouch u know effect and make like Opcatiy to color red or black idk that it good idea and make animation/speed on diamond key move
5,jrhdusmfiemrudrn,This app is great but It’s messed up all my music I was making the perfect movie and it messed it all up and now I’m sad but it is a great app to start off with :)
4,✨starlight,"This app is incredible! But whenever I forget to get a video for an audio, I save it, I go back and it doesn’t show the video for audio, fix that please"
5,Spritefalcon,"Settings and feature rich and is made by the same company as tiktok, so very useful for social media. I especially like the 3d zoom effect"
5,Yeetskeet101,"This app is the best editing app by far. And yes this is a real person righting this review. This is an awesome app, it might take a few days to get used to the setting and figure it out."
2,bxbhxhdh,It was working for a while but now it’s saying that I don’t have enough space when I have a ton of space left I have literally deleted a lot of videos and pictures and deleted all of my projects but it keeps saying I don’t have enough space
3,taraji potty💕,Ok the app is very good but the thing when I have space it says “Not enough memory” But I have space I deleted most of my apps and it still says  “Not enough memory” so if y’all could change that It would be very helpful🥱
4,jfudotxhdo,"When I got tie app at first I saw a good star rating so I decided to try it, and when I edited my first video I was shook! It was a lot of stickers I used so much that it was too far- But so far I love the edits the shorts, and everything else!"
5,loser._.addison,I been making so many anime/Roblox or more stuff with this awesome app !! I love everything about it I been kinda getting likes and I recommends some people
4,L o n dy,But I really wish that you could also add this for PC because there are not a lot of PC editing apps out there that are free or very easy to use like CapCut so if that is possible that would be great!
5,TTkShapz,I love CapCut! It had many different ways to edit clips and photos! I’m not sure what else to say but it’s free and better than pics art in allllllll ways!!!!!
5,cammie4311,Cap cut is amazing what it needs some changing. I recommend everything is free. Because my mom hates when she has a to buy an app it is amazing I recommend it
3,hoogld 565,I use this app to make edits for tiktok. don’t get me wrong the tools are great but I was having trouble using my phone the other day so I looked and this app took up 10 GBS OF STORAGE! I really like the app and it’s a shame it takes up so much space.
5,nats🦋,ok so i saw some people from the fandom that i’m in use this app so i got it!! IM IN LOVE!! you don’t have to buy anything and there is everything i could want! so thank you for this lovely app!! 💜
4,Ella0521,So l got in l pressed overlay didn’t let me press it and l was like let re-download it and  other stuff when you press a new project didn’t let me and l know this is shorts but l want to address this to the makers of this please fix it.
5,bayhya,"Ok so you may have seen the star rate and I think it is amazing app for like,memes,music videos and,videos it has like better effects and is amazing for me and it is so amazing for talented people and it is so amazing!"
5,skullboygamer987,This is the best mobile editing app for my plush videos and stuff no watermark so many effects and filters and ECT all for free? Man this is so worth getting I highly recommend this
5,i dont have a nice name,I don’t understand why can’t u put the in and out animation together? like fade in fade out Please respond And please change that it would be amazing if u do thanks!
4,Me me loves unicorns,"So capcut is pretty good for beginner editors but they removed the style button which had auto velocity, 3D zoom etc which was pretty annoying. That was one of the best features imo"
5,squishyashell,It’s great and I love using it but it won’t let me download some effects??(it’s not my connection because I can download some stuff but not others)
5,Vanss?,I really love this app. Everything is so good and easy to use but I would love it if you guys could put gifs to work from your photo library
5,MaddieTheKittin,This is hands down the best editing app I’ve ever seen! It helps me so much with work! And it’s really easy to use. I would highly recommend this app. ❤️❤️❤️
5,lil bear ❤️❤️❤️,This app is AMAZING for beginners and you can do a lot with this app it is very easy to learn how to use. This app has helped me a lot I definitely recommend!
5,Enter:...,It’s really good for editing this is how I got into it! But not for velocity that’s the only thing u guys got rid of “style” and now I can’t do anymore velocity but other then that it’s nice!
2,JBTV4,"- updates do not reset fonts of text  - no audio delay when playing video - you can apply animation to multiple text blocks at once (for example, animation apply to all captions) - auto captions doesn’t crash a video"
4,by number girl,So this is a amazing editing app I have been using but I just updated it and lousy a edit I was working on all my hard work lost. :(
3,noneofypurfuckingbuisness,It’s good for the most part. The problem is that  sometimes I can’t can’t add pictures and I have good internet so I know that not the reason. Plus I can’t add sounds sometimes and it just gets on my nerves to be honest
4,poka dots and lines,"I love cap cut, don't get me wrong, BUT PLEASE STOP CHANGING THE TEXT SIZE! cap cut keeps changing how big the font is, so when i go to an old edit to rewatch, the text is too small or off the screen!!! plz stop doing this(it's only with the system text btw)"
2,your_local_bestie00,i make gacha life videos and i take a lot of screenshots. the problem im having is that it is very laggy whenever I play it. so i have to keep on exporting the video. which is very very annoying. this really isn’t the app for you if you do gacha videos and you make smooth animations.
5,IdleGameMan,Me and my friend love this app so much! and I use this app to make all my videos on my channel so I just want to thank you for this amazing app.
3,pryton pritertj,"I can’t put an overlay on my edit. It doesn’t work. It goes from 15% to 50% then stops. It is not my phone, it’s new, I got it a month ago. Nothing is loading and I am mad. I have done everything I could."
3,-*-Rosie-*-,I just got this app on my new tablet and now it’s saying I have a lot of storage even tho I got 5 pics and like 11 games. I’m a mobile user and would just like to say be careful cause I had to delete the app to fix this..
5,zv_sz,"The app is great, but I do believe we should be able to add keyframes to our effects to make our own custom transitions."
5,Aviana2345,I love capcut I can make gacha edits and do velocity edits and it has made my life improve and it’s really smooth and doesn’t glitch like others editing apps do
5,CookieCatKam,"Since you had added stuff like reverse, velocity, and new effects, I have made millions of good edits that I post. They usually get about 1k views. Thank you CapCut!"
4,AjayCartoonz,So far I’ve been enjoying it but I’ve been having a problem with the tiktok sounds which won’t update in capcut when I add new ones to my favorites
5,CrazyKuala,"i use this app,for editing and it’s amazing very easy and i highly suggest u download it it’s perfect for kids or teens OR adults honestly just so easy and fun"
4,Sunset/Mira,Capcut is great-ish at the beginning but it now starts to say that i have no network even when it’s fantastic everything is good though just please fix this
3,ur dad is ur mom sonny,"Okay first of all I’d like to say that I really like this app, I like it so much that I want it to be better, because litterally this app requires so many storage like I barely have photos and apps because of this and IT STILL SAYS I MY STORAGE IS FULL, LIKE I HAVE TO DELETE MY FAVORITE APPS JUST FOR THIS EVEN MY PHOTOS LIKE WHY"
4,rezn0,I really love this app but when i want to but a tiktok audio on it throught capcut it says connect to internet and try again and my internet is perfectly fine please help me. 🥲
4,Hnskqoqnwbw𝖏𝖉𝖚𝖜𝖏𝖜,"I LOVEEEEE CAPCUT! It’s so simple easy, and best of all it’s free! It takes my editing to another level at no difficulty or cost! I just wish there was an update patching the glitch where text animations don’t work. Tysm!"
1,animefreakidk,I’ve been trying to change the opacity of the text that I put and it isn’t letting me do it at all. I’ve tried updating it and it still didn’t work. I don’t want to delete the app because I have a bunch of unfinished projects in there. Please fix this as soon as you can so that can keep using this app that I love so much.
3,HeyyItsRia,"Yesterday when I was on it, it won’t let me put a video or a picture in, it says I have to check my settings but i think it is on and it still won’t let me put the video/picture…"
3,misuredi,"Whenever my app updates it reset all the text on my edits to default, please add an option where I can press “add all” on a font to change the font on every text, this goes for animations as well"
4,pankcake13455,So I have used CapCut for about a year now but it has not been working rn but I think I will give is a 4 out of five bc it is very good but I think there is problem with it but overall it is amazing
5,Ras-sarv-e,"This is an amazing editing app, I can make so many awesome edits with this app. It’s also free with no subscription! It’s amazing app and it’s easy to figure out! It has amazing effects animations and much more!"
3,Little_AngleGachaRoblox,"I love this app but it won’t let me make a video because it says I don’t have storage to make one but I’ve deleted over 8,000 pictures in my phone and deleted most of my apps and it still won’t work"
4,Roblox Lover (Paris),"This app is really good, and everything’s free. But when i make a capcut edit with the keyframes, the keyframes look pretty bad. I wish there was graphs like alight motion. If graphs were added, it would be probably the best capcut update"
3,𝚈𝚘𝚞𝚛 𝚕𝚘𝚌𝚊𝚕 𝚌𝚕𝚘𝚠𝚗,I went to capcut to edit an animation i had just made i put the photos in and it keeps glitching like it gets stuck on photos and freezes i keep refreshing it and it wont work i dont know why but otherwhise the app is good
3,J squad🍪🤟🐇,"Ok so I don’t have much games or photos,I clicked the new project button and it said I didn’t have storage so I was like ok let me click the short project thinking it would be different but it said the same thing.."
3,Toko♫🏳️‍🌈,I hate how there’s so many updates I’m glad there’s new features but once there’s an update the app gets laggy. And it won’t let me access any of the videos I have. this app needs to be fixed
4,hdhdhdhsbbd,The app is very good but the reason I gave it a 4 star is because sometimes when I try to add pictures or videos while I have it open it doesn’t let me
2,Emmalde,So when I’m done editing I need effects or like why would I even use this if there is NO effects (I make tik tok trends that need affects) and it says I have no internet! It’s very annoying so I may switch to somewhere else where I can do effects!
5,Kawaii_kitty_Cookie,PLEASE add graphs if you use keyframes to make your own transition!! I’ve been using this for 2 years now and it would be super duper helpful because it would make my transitions SO much smoother! (Channel is Vo1kk on yt btw) ☺️
5,Bingo cloud,This app is amazing and I’ve been using it for a while. I request if you could make a pitch ranging effect to this app and some other transitions!
5,vierdog,"this app is so great! i reccomended it to all of my friends i’m just so impressed! it’s completely free as far as i know, i haven’t gotten any ads, and its so great! even the watermark is at the end and its not huge and obnoxious *cough cough kinemaster* i came here from alight motion but i couldn’t handle it because it was too laggy, but i haven’t experienced any lag with this! its super great, you should try it out"
5,Roblox editorrr,I love this app but the slomo is like taking pictures and looks so laggy if you could change it to smooth it would be great to capcut editors
3,nayeoncores,So basically I would have to delete apps because it says my phone storage is full but I have a little bit of apps this doesn’t make sense but I really recommend to get this app this app helps you a lot
4,LEEEEEEE EE E. E E E,It keep telling me I have to allow CapCut to download videos so when I go to settings there is nothing for me to allow? So I can’t use CapCut until it’s fixed /:
5,BriarRoseSmith,"i absolutely love this app it makes editing videos easy, it also doesn’t beg you to buy premium every 5 minutes, which I also love."
5,RedArt1106,"Can you add where you can copy and paste key frames? I have a question, Is it possible to delete a split?"
5,🏁🥀😎🖤💄🌈🥺👅,It keeps saying it’s download but It won’t load onto my Home Screen and it keeps loading
4,WK R,This app is honestly one of my favorites. Some changes I would make though would be storage. I have used 4.3/50GB and it won’t let me into any of my edits. Other than that I like the app :)
4,supersam842,"Great features and effects. Recently when I put effects on my video, sometimes the effects doesn’t show on my video."
4,Ok butt bigssd,"The app is pretty good, it's just that whenever I was editing a video and I only had one more photo left, it said that I have too much storage."
5,_L_I_N_D_Z_,I love love love capcut it is free and has everything you need to make awesome videos! It has a water mark clip at the end but is easy to crop out!!! Very satisfied! 100% reccomend!
5,badmintonplaya,I love this app but if they had better fonts it would make it a whole lot better!
4,lynnsiefortenberry,"Don’t get me wrong, it’s a really great editing app! But when I try to edit something, there’s always one photo that lags and stays on the screen and I don’t know how to fix it so it’s been bugging me."
1,Ashlovesbunnies555,I keep trying to add transitions or anything else like stickers etc. but it keeps saying that I have no internet but my internet is working completely fine and I have deleted it and downloaded it several times in the hopes that it will be fixed but nothing happened please look into the issue fast!!
5,hedyhdeuhhdeu,So yesterday I deleted capcut Bc I it acting strange and now when I’m trying to get it back it’s saying manage payments and I’m rlly confused can someone tell me what to do?
5,꧁ᥴꪖρᥴꪊ𝓽꧂✔︎✔︎✔︎,Capcut is amazing and I’ve been using it for a long time now!! They should at least add ultra shake transitions like video star because those are cool! Other than that Capcut is 5 stars 🤩✨
5,leonjr2010,I always do commentary but I need a app to do it so I choose this one and it’s good because you do not even have to pay for it
1,🐅🐆🐕🦙,I’m a new editor and just want simple edits and I’ve seen people use this app and the translations and clean and smooth but when I downloaded the app it wouldn’t let me do anything it had said my internet was slow My internet was strong and even if I disconnected my mobile data is also strong so I don’t know why I’m not able to add anything
3,let me make a vidoe dumb,I just deleted so many photos from my phone so many apps I barely have ANY I’ve given up so much and capcut won’t let me edit. It’s good when I CAN USE IT! But all this “you can’t make a vidoe” thing is dumb! Stop or I’ll have me and my 11 K followers uninstall capcut and leave bad reviews
5,hey a Eevee wow 🥰🥰🥰🥳🥳,CapCut is a amazing app to edit things with rather it be videos of yourself family or even something digital! If u need to edit I recommend CapCut and IMovie (iMovie if ur a apple user)
4,Nahomi R. Lopez Mora,CapCut is a AMAZING editing app and super easy to use but recently it won’t let me get into my project it says it may consume cellular data then the app freezes and won’t work anymore can this please be fixed
4,gigivivas,"So i’ve been using Capcut for a while but since yesterday it wouldn’t let me add effects or add a sound. Idk what to do to fix it, but overall its a good app and it’s so much easier to make an edit :)"
5,KIDawesomness54,This is finally a step up from using iMovie. I have more freedom and accessibility than ever before without paying for anything!
5,SoupKeef,"Just in case y’all think I got payed to say this. I love sucking big fat dicks and love light skin boys, just playing. But anyway this app is really good for having fun and making music videos."
5,lleslyyo,I’ve been trying to find a good editing app but never could until someone recommended me this one!! and i love it ! i use it very daily !
5,acexxo,"This app is so good it’s better than inshot, the only reason I switched to this app is because the transitions are FREE!!! F-R-E-E everything is free with top quality. My only request is that you make it more vibrant and not just black and white...."
5,uncornbell12345hd,Why did you take out the velocity edit thing I use tjat all the time and I need it so put it back
5,Robinskaya,"I really like CapCut, but one day when i opened it, all my edits we’re gone! So I couldn’t use it that day but,from that day on my edits we’re staying!😊"
5,strawberry Dino,It’s probably one of my favorite editing apps for beginners. It’s easy for beginners and has free velocity + other effects. I recommend this app if you’re a beginner! :)
3,MadGamez YT on Yt,"Used to use this app all the time, but recently it’s been having a huge bug that ruins the entire app. Every time I try to edit a video, the audio is always delayed. It’s horrible."
5,CAULAYIA,"This work of art, got me 17 followers, I love how it just goes to photos and u can like edit any part. And you don’t have to pay."
5,jagjoot,"I really love this app. I wish they would add a feature to make a account so that way whenever you log in all of your projects can be saved. But  overall, LOVVVEEEE ITTTT!!!!🥳🤩🤩"
4,ava the funny one,I deleted so much stuff to put in and then All of a sudden all my projects deleted and It didn’t let me see them but overall good app.
5,ry riley,CapCut helped me with editing and it has filters  because im not aloud to have Snapchat sadly and it has tons of effects and filters and transitions 💗💗💗
5,Alishan_kurdi,"A very wonderful program, thank you, but it does not support writing in Arabic. Please add the Arabic language in the program as well, not an order"
1,ndjdjehww,I just started to use the app and its amazing i edited one video of 2k22 for my tiktok and when i wanted to edit any other video now it tells me to connect to wifi to use a tiktok sound but im already connected to wi fi and i already got a really REALLY good service on my phone so it should work no matter what so please if you read this help me.
1,Dubs719,"Today when using the app, all of my video clips are just black. There is also no audio. I’ve restarted my phone, deleted and reinstalled the app and tried tons of different videos but I can’t fix the issue. This app worked great yesterday. I use this app weekly and now it no longer works."
4,allylovesdogs2010,I love this app but one think that stinks is that you can’t save it to your camera roll and if I’m wrong about that please tell me bc I would like to save it to my camera roll.
4,mom nora,"It’s a really good editing app, but if I try to animate anything and then export it, it makes the parts towards the end REALLY choppy. And then it looks weird! Could you fix that possibly?"
1,Ayy.ItzMeKails,"I was making a video for my channel. I had worked VERY hard on it, and I was trying to delete another edit I made but accidentally deleted the one I spent so much time on. I really wish there was a recovery thing on the app where you can get back the edits you deleted. Unless there is a way, I’m not using this app. Please respond"
5,kyleguesttt,This is by far one of the easiest apps to use for editing videos but I wish they added velocity tools for it.
2,anim Queen,I use to love this app but now I don’t i Download the new TikTok thing we’re you put your TikTok account information in capcut and it will let you use your sounds well every time I get on it it kicks me out or says I don’t have Wi-Fi like today it deleted all my TikTok sounds off my phone.😪
5,Sammy Sösa,"This app is great but if you make a video that’s too big of a file it won’t render and it will keep crashing , so no 1080p 60 fps"
5,Copley IPad,"Before, I used iMovie, what an upgrade this is. It’s so useful and convenient and the animating tools spice everything up. I love how precise the timing is and it’s just… wow."
4,Jorge 123,I like editing with CapCut. It’s nice! But I would like to tween. You see I try to animate body parts but it’s sort of hard since it’s sort of not good tweening. Can you please fix this?
5,taideguy,"I generally count myself as a decently experienced editor in programs such as premiere pro, capcut is the mobile version of that. The ui is great, and you can do a lot."
5,Queeenbed12345678910,I love the app but their is one problem is that their is not a lot of songs so maybe let people pick out their songs                                                                              Pls
4,izumi midprya,I’ve been on this app for a while it’s great and everything but I tried chroma key and the this that u pick the color with is like to the side so I can’t get it
5,RockHarderSoCool,"Free, no ads, and not even an in app purchase like a premium mode. It is the best app to use for mobile and has a wide range of effects."
4,ufbvrjjfvhjfhfirhfirfj,If we could keyframe everything INCLUDING effects that would be greatly appreciated! Small but very helpful change.
3,🄹🄰🅈🄳🄴🄽12,So I went in calcite and I just wanted to edit a video and it said “ Requires access to the album” so I went and hit confirm and it’s still not working and I can’t make videos anymore so I don’t know what to do now.
4,John Valentine Uk,I love everything about this app and I believe there's room for improvement. Please I just need a MacOS version. Editing on my iPhone is really too busy for me.  I want you to beat VN video editor. Thank you
4,erikabeldin,Capcut is an amazing editing app I do a lot of cool and amazing edits because of the app and I love it it’s just I wish it didn’t bother you so much about your space in your phone but other than that it’s amazing.😁
4,paolitoisagod1234,Deleted all my data when deleted by accident pls bring back my data!!!
4,Angel_love143,"So I lost my data twice, I didn’t do anything. Please fix that I deleted it and tried to redownload but I can’t redownload right now please fix the data lost thing"
5,Jsjsjkkwlwo,So far so good but the only problem I have with it is the video speed it comes out really laggy and not as good as I expected
4,LaurenfunTV,I think you should have a tutorial on how you can like do things and where to get them to make it more helpful and so it can be understanding more
3,Dexter..not.found,"It's a great app for the most part, idk if it was just my phone, but it wouldn't let me create a new edit, click on an edit, or download an edit, all bc my ""storage was full"" even tho I cleared out all of my photos, and most of my apps"
5,gorda_said_cars,It good but if you don’t know the app like me you get mad so I went on yt and saw it not that hard so it very fun so much get it but you get mad cuz you don’t know much
4,kool-aid man oh yeah grape,I love the new update effects! I hope y’all can add more. It’s just lags if you do too much editing and you has to copy to a new slot to fix it is a bit frustrating
4,트와이스 as nice,"So I use CapCut to edit my videos and I have to say, I am very impressed but when I pressed done from trimming the audio I had exported, It went back to it's original length. Please fix this but voe great app."
4,🌸missycat🌸,"Is ok it really easy to use tho!I just wish you can choose music from people it hard to get a good song for my intro but,over all it pretty good and easy to use!"
5,tempo hsisn,Ok so the app is really good! Buts there’s a problem if u don’t have enough storage u can’t use the app forcing u to delete some some other apps

4,Kholmes02!,It’s the apps on your phone or iPad or what ever u on just look how many apps u have on there if u don’t use any delete some I give it 4 stars. 😀
4,Jessi Welner,"This app is great, user-friendly and has no watermark. I use it for text on my video edits.   I would love more options for animation effects for text, specifically something similar to turbulent displace.   I also wish we were able to upload our own fonts. It would be more customizable.  I love this app and I love how easy it is to use. I just would love to see these two things in an update sometime in the future."
4,iqnwkiaosksjjs,"The thing that i love about this app, is that you can do almost everything. I wish they added a pitch changer that was separated from the speed, but other than that, it’s a great app."
4,ShlumpGaming,I think it has something to do with photos and overlays being added
5,elephantswimmer,"Best editing app by far!! All of the edits are free and easy to use unlike other editing apps! Theirs also a variety of things to chose from, which I absolutely love!!"

4,Tia1000000000463873373373,This app is really great but when I first got this it said add some Storage even tho my storage was not full not even close to being full but the app is really great

5,FREE SHA VOCA DOO,"I love this app, and I’ve made nice photo edits on it, but you should add a thing where you can put animated photos in it like a gif. Other than that the app is great!"

5,hornynibba,This app is really good but you should add some settings for the Bling effects so it gives us the option on how much to add or not to have any
5,OOGIEBOOGIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,Capcut is the best app to use for editing because it has NO watermark and lets you save it with out any paying! I personally really think that it is a good app!
5,maheen 88,When I got this app i thought the app would have a watermark there is no water mark which  is amazing I would recommend this app.
5,aim3e,"i love using this app for like short school project videos, but if you plan on using it to edit, please don’t bc many overlays/transitions/effects take a lot of effort for editors to make/use and the traditional version of editing is to make them on your own!! other than that, this app has a lot of filters, effects, transitions, and tools that make using it really easy!!"
5,ɑƙҽҽ,It’s really amazing since there’s great features and really good quality and its crazy how it doesn’t have a watermark and you don’t need to pay for anything! It’s amazing! 😲🤩

4,#Closer2God,"I absolutely love CapCut, it’s amazing, but it’s been really slow lately and I’ve tried everything. I’ve even updated the app. It’s really easy and good for beginners, just slow"
3,Laurel72,Was working great and then the style option disappeared with the 3d zoom feature. Ended up deleting app. I loved it until that happened.
5,NotBlaze,CapCut has many features to use. This app has easy to use effects and transitions. I’d like to have tracking for overlays.

4,{*(Cringy Queen)*},"Okay Capcut, I like your app, a little too much. But theres this one thing that always messes me up. How you cant put 2 animations on at once. J would LOVE to be able to put an ‘In’ animation with a ‘Combo’ one. Thank you 😍😍😍😍"
5,shaylaw💗,I usually make velocity bases on capcut because it’s easy and quick!Capcut has amazing features and I can’t wait for them to add more:)!
5,/e Delfan Eoten Cor,1. Smoother slo mo like VSCO 2. Add keyframes to the effects to make them faster and the users likings 3. Over the app Is good If you do this I guarantee more people are going to download this app

5,Desihappens,"They should add graphs ! It would help with editing and make even better edits , and maybe smooth slow mos?"
3,giannnabryant90,This app is a god app but my recommendations is to put a better motion blur so it won’t look laggy my other recommendations is that you guys but some more filters so that the screen won’t look old but this is a really good just missing stuff
5,Chatoria young,This is absolutely amazing!! But I'm feeling there needs to be a smooth slomo I mean Ik we can use other apps for that but like can you put smooth slomo?
5,Sockerboi69,This would be the perfect app if it didn’t completely destroy video quality
5,odkdkkdks,"I love this app. But I have one tiny problem, the quality. Is it because I have a low quality phone, or is it the app?"

3,Passive Barbarian,"I make videos on an iPad and when I use this, the video is always very very cropped. Other than that, everything is good. It just annoys me because the cropped video looks weird."
4,hirobloxisfunlikeminecraft,I love the app bit you should add keyframes for the effects because of the the effects are kinda useless if you cant use keyframes for them
1,undhxbdh,Whenever I’m finishing up a video or editing it is just stop work an send me back to my home screen and I hate that so much and is annoying. When I’m done with a video is half way finish exporting it glitches out my phone now I can’t listen to music no more all I hear is some audio from a video I made. What the hell
5,peegirl10,I went to edit a video and looked over to for the “style” option and it’s not there please fix this a soon as possible ?! FIX IT PLEASEEEE WE NEED STYLE BACK
3,Grey G,I love the app! I use it for all my edits. Only problem is you guys removed the “style” category. This category had an Auto Velocity many users have the app for including me. Please bring this back
4,toasty sus,Capcut is very easy to use and I like that easily accessible and when you combine effects it looks amazing…tho I do wish capcut had more warping effects and animations tbh great app tho
5,AMAZING APP LIKE LOOOOLLL,OMG AMAZING im looking at other bad reviews and DONT LISTEN TO THEM!!! This app is amazing I’ve been using it for almost a year now I love it so much there’s no ads it’s free and I love it so much ^^
5,bruh or u fat,I would really consider getting this at the start it was hard but now it’s ez
5,✨tHe AuDaCiTy✨,Velocity is working amazing! But what would be amazing is if you could change the speed of the auto velocity! ☺️
4,kdjsjdhruruhdydyf,"I opened cap cut to finish my edit but it froze. Soon I looked at CapCut at the App Store I looked what’s new, usually there would be bugs fixed but they weren’t there, so please fix bugs."
4,Soft_Dino;),"Ok, let’s just start off, this app is amazing!! But here are some things I saw that I think you should fix.☺️  1• When I Add To Many Overlays, it always says, “ sorry you put on too many overlays, take some off please. Thank you!”  2• Also When I Add Too Much Texts, Then They WARN Me that I can’t add anymore texts!? That’s just unbelievable.  I Think You Could Fix All Of These Problems That I Witnessed.  Thank You!😊✨✨"
4,KuroTheFluer,this is so easy to understand i literally got used to it. I used this app for years and i love it. But the graphs is kinda choppy. I suggest make it smooth. All i have to say.
2,martinrod34,I’ve been using cap cut for a while now and it’s a good app for editing but when ever I make an edit it takes way to long to upload to my device I could wait a hour just for a 3 minute video please fix this issue
5,i like cookie doe,10/10 it’s a amazing app it’s helps you edit for beginners and it’s way better than video star cause it’s for free!
2,ROBLOX is meh life,So I was on the app the other day and it was working perfectly fine and I decided to get on it today and it deleted all of my progress like all of it and I’m really really upset I hope this problem can get fixed
5,MD Rajin,It is the good app for edit. Here you find more edit option. The edit is mind blowing if you edit with capcut. In one word It's Amazing
5,I suggest you use capcut,CapCut is a very good editing app when I was new to editing it was very easy very free and I suggest you guys use it.  This is the most easiest editing app I’ve ever used!
4,Alston Hai,It’s a great animation app but I stopped using it after awhile and forgot where the good animations are. Please add a button so you can see everything that you put on a clip.
5,kilypoobear,There could be more and stuff but I recommend because it’s easier to use
4,evervqngers,"so i am obsessed with capcut but i don’t have a certain effect that i would love to use it’s zoom in and i am pretty upset with that 😭, anyways i recommend for any type of editor!!!"
4,goooddd gaaammmmeeee,So best app EVER but pls put animations so I can do some clean edits I love this app if you are reading this you should download this cuz is the best app I ever used so far *for editing * so you heard me put some animations and your good!
4,cake da best,"I want the slow mo to be way more smoother, and when you do velocity I want it smooth also, so we don’t have to use more hard apps for editing."
5,hdgvs sjsbsvbs,It’s a really amazing app but the thing I don’t like is when you cant put too much overlay :( but still amazing
4,Cebray,This app is really easy to use and is very good but when you try to watch while editing it is very laggy and sometimes deletes my projects🙁 capcut please fix this
5,yellabe gm,i love this app its easy to use specially for begging its all free easy to understand you get the amazing results you want in under 10 minutes i feel like even if you think you cant edit this is good for you and its very clear no laggy edits or videos you can add effects extract audios and way more!i love it!!
4,😗👉👈,ive been using capcut to edit for a while now and havent had a single issue EXCEPTTT it will not let me animate stickers whatsoever. other than that perfect
4,boo the cute star,So it’s pretty good it’s pretty easy to use! It’s just that I keep having to use the same transitions which it’s annoying since I use it a lot. But overall it’s pretty good!
4,Cedric Diggory Bub,Okay Capcut is good but why did you put the thing on the text we want it to be see though not with a white box that’s the only bad thing 🙄
5,Vqnillavfx,i use it everyday i just have on improvement can you add keyframe graphs ? if you do it will be better than good
5,Anjelic Dreams,"I like the transitions, and how they are premade! But some of them don’t have motion blur while others do and that kinda bothers me. So if you could please add motion blur to the transitions and this app needs graphs."
1,jjubyvji,i would not recommend this video editing app. It takes up all of your storage add you have to clear all of your pictures and apps just to make it. At first i thought the app was amazing bit really they don’t even have any good things. i hate this app and definitely do not recommend.
4,ikpaju,It’s a great app but it needs proper upgrading that would prevent it from hanging or glitching when someone tries to edit. Quite frustrating when thang happens. Please do something.
5,ASKck2000,I was trying to use the style and it wasn’t working I tried so ugh things
5,gorgebao,It’s one of the best editing apps in my opinion  But if they could add so pinch effects and better transitions that would be good
4,anime weeb boi gurl,Don’t get me wrong- it’s great! But when I wanna make a video it sometimes says my storage is full but there’s nothing anywhere nothing in my camera roll nothing!
4,jeweliab,I have been useing this app for 7 mounts but y’all keep saying my storage is full I only have 2 games and 4 pictures and 0 videos I’m about to delete this app stop!

5,me_rafinha,"I’m just here to say that this is literally the BEST video editor EVER.I discovered it when it was not that famous, and I was like...Why this app is not famous ?I’m just saying that CapCut is the BEST."
5,yaknowtypebeat,It has no in app purchases or watermark!! That’s incredible!  It’s easy to use and has a lot of tools that would normally cost money.  I have made a lot of edits using this app 10/10 would recommend if you do edits or tts.  I’m honestly impressed I felt relieved when I finally got an editing app that I can work with.  So to the developers THANK YOU!🥰

I tried looking for updates and tried restarting my phone multiple times but the app still did not work."
5,UniPuppyHailey,I think it would be a great idea to add warp zone zoom strips as an affect ! Since you can’t do it on most mobile apps.
5,coreyon23,I love this app I use it to make music videos we just need the glow effects to put on people other than that it’s good
5,THE REAL CHASE HUDSON,So i decided to re download capcut and for some reason when I press overlay and other stuff It doesn’t work !!!   Plssss fix this!!

2,💅hellow,O had cap cut for like 5 months and i never was able to understand anything and it made me get a lot of hate of my edited videos saying they were “childish”  and “poorly made”  i really hope it becomes more easier 🙁
5,no comment 11,I think this app is good I like to edit things on this app this is one of my favorite apps if you don’t have it then get it now!!!☺️☺️☺️

4,figure out my real name,This is a great app but I keep seeing the same stuff and it’s kinda annoying. It’s a great app but if your looking for something more advanced this is not the app for you.
5,juanjose y anna,"10/10 app would 100% recommend, i do a lot of edits on this and they all come out exactly how i want"

1,donqueman,Just downloaded the app and my video never import I literally had to reinstall the app twice and still barely got all my videos to import. I’m not sure what else I need to do to improve this issue but it’s very frustrating when it comes to the daily content I’m trying to make.
4,TocoXkids,I really love using this app but for some reason my text boxes keep disappearing and or moving to another slide even thought it says it there but it’s not.
5,ajuagsgsy,I used to use kinemaster for my video editing. I heard about CapCut and wanted to try it out. IT WAS ALREADY SO MUCH BETTER. I will be using this app for my video editing now.
3,Emperor Palpatine Rules,"Beauty effects are glitched. Every time I try to apply them, it seems fine, but once I export the video, it looks noticeably pixelated. Ran into this problem over a month ago. Hoped they’d fixed it by now."
4,kendalstrike,Capcut is great it just need some features like graphs but besides that it’s a great app the app was my first editing choice but i spend too much storage but it’s great for beginners who don’t know what or how to edit
4,q152527373644,"I like the app but it takes up too much storage. I’ve deleted so many of my favorite apps, games and photos and it still says not enough storage."
5,AVATAR IS AWESOME!,"WHY ARE YOU READING THIS, JUST GET IT ALREADY (the only suggestion I have is if it had the music where you could just search a song up on the app and add it to ur vid)"
5,housepqrtyhfeth,It’s amazing but it takes up a lot of storage so I recommend having a lot of storage If you get it
5,mart4549,Add an option for us to upload our own fonts instead of using the BORING ones that are one there.  THATS MY ONLY POINTER #letusaddourownfonts 🙈🥰🤣🥺💋
3,charliaep,I love this app I use it for all of my edits it’s wonderful but there are two issues. There are no graphics in this app my moving edits don’t look good and the keyframe glitches sometimes I love this but it needs graphics.

4,lily legend,"So, I love this app and it’s great but,I saw that you can make your own transitions so I tired a zoom in but it’s not smooth so could you guys add graphs like how Funimate and after effects have? Thanks overall this app is great!"
3,Sagar 🇳🇵,"Honestly i am very much happy with this app, but being happy doesn’t mean being ultimately happy for me this app lacks some features like  1. Background noise cancellation (background noise in voiceover makes voiceover dusty) 2. Language problem (This is particularly for Nepal, we cannot add our own language, so it would be great if we could write in our own native language)  I hope the coming update responds to this matter as well.  Thank you Love from Nepal🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵"

5,craft skin color is the best,"Hello capcut I was very new to this app I always saw people use it for videos I thought it would be hard.  It wasn’t at all I just needed help with the overlays I learned that sooner and yeah it was a great app.  My favorite part was when you have the velocity it help really well for my video edits, it moves nice and slow I like to create mines for voices tho.  Ty for this app capcut have a wonderful day."

4,GABBY@&&,I like CapCut the only thing I don’t like is when it says “storage full” and when I empty my storage it will keep say storage full. WHEN I LITERALLY DELETED EVERYTHING FROM MY PHONE anyways I would of loved it if wasn’t saying storage full

5,😢pls stop,So I try like every editor apps but never understand so I saw capcut then I realized that I understand and that’s why it’s a very good app.
2,Ilia_Sky,"I love the ability to use all of the effects and editing tools form TikTok, but when I try to use TikTok sounds it keeps saying I am not connected to the internet (although I clearly am - that’s how I’m submitting this review). With the sounds, it loses most of its appeal."
5,HappyHanako,I really like it :) I just wish that it lets you change the pitch of extracted audio.
1,Cesecocj1990?1,Why is it necessary that this app has to follow you what you are doing in the internet. I don’t know🤷 Why do they need to see all my contacts? I don’t know. It has nothing to do with the working of the app so stop now doing this. I think we sit using this app before the privacy and following acts are gone.
5,Paul Giurleo,A really great app has lots of helpful tools for edits I would recommend it to every single small editor!
2,jbell9,When I first got this app is was working SO GOOD but then throughout the years it started glitching asking me weird stuff. It also kept taking away my edits and making me delete my best ones😤👎. This game is not good the updates aren’t even helpful.
3,jenniferispoggers,Whenever I try to make something shorter it doesn’t work it just glitches out and I can’t post it so you should fix that. Over all the app is ok just make it better.

1,BabyGirl_2k,I’m sorry but I’ve been deleting things and deleting things and everytime I get back on the app it always has to say for me to clean up more storage when I done erased over 3000 photos and videos and deleted multiple apps!! Don’t get me wrong this is a cool app and good to make edits on! But it just isn’t quiet good whenever I try! Have a nice day.✨
4,Person123872,"So I’ve gotten into make edits, I’m so happy I found CapCut. Though it isn’t updating, I don’t know if it takes a minute. Very good if your into making gacha edits! Would recommend!"
3,WolfyOwl,"So I’ve been using CapCut to edit photos and it is amazing. There is a flaw however. When adjusting the time limit for photos, you should be allowed to set the duration for all photos, not just one at a time."
5,datboiskittle,I use lots of editing apps but this is the best one in my opinion. Developers please keep doing what your doing I love this app my favorite.
5,lovely day 🥺,I love this app! It’s so easy to use and I love it very much! You definitely get this app it’s awesome for edits! I made stuff that I thought I could never do!

3,Niikiloo,"Auto velocity is gone from my app for some reason. When I need to make a edit but don’t have the energy to actually take all the time, THIS makes me MAD. Why is it gone? Fix it."
5,ningdoo,THE SLOWMO STYLE THING IS GONE!!!  And that’s the only thing that actually made it fun to use CapCut.  Is it not available in iPhone no more? My friends Samsung still has it.
4,Lon_Lon2,I am not the biggest editor and this app makes thing easier I just wish I could use it on my computer
5,santiagoanta,I just use this for editing music and it really helps a lot thanks!
4,sama ur mama,Every time I try to do smooth slow motion a random green frame pops up and ruins the whole edit please fix this issue<33
4,uncle Josie,I see so many people having fun with the app with the that new update but I can’t find it like where is it😡😡😡😡 The apps fine but I just can’t find the new thing in the app😡😡😡
5,nick name my as-,"FReEeEeEeEEeEeEEEE!!!!!! It’s free, what else could you want, well I mean you could want more funny video effects and a better font (meme font for example) but overall free and useful."

5,bellalover36,I have made many things for my family and myself that are just so amazing and all because if this app
5,bzcakes,Rhdhdhrhdhfh

1,gap snapple,this is horrible i try to make an edit and when i play it it stops on its own or plays the same photo over and over again i wouldn't recommend using this app for editing videos or photos it has been really glitchy lately and not working.
4,chcnxm nxkvw,CapCut is not letting me put any audio. It’s just telling me that I don’t have any connection whatsoever? Overall this app is amazing and I hope this keeps going!
5,Xxicantthink,It’s amazing the things you can do with it is amazing!i use 24/7 to edit my roblox edits
5,hibesdcibjddwcwdwnuiidwcnj,Cap cut is really nice but it can get a bit confusing at start but when you go it’s really easy!
4,sammy wammy pammy,"I got to say CapCut is super good but the fonts aren’t too cool, and the effects are quite boring but another than that it’s doing great for me !  That’s all I think you guys should change."
4,kkaarreeee,I loved to edit stuff here but then my storage started to act up so I had to delete it I was sad but the storage was back
4,amazing just need motion blur,This is an amazing app! I’ve used it to make edit videos. The only thing I would like for you guys to add is motion blur! I love the graphs they are very good but they don’t look right without motion blur
4,cupcake unicorn heart,So basically it won’t work when I try to get the app again but it’s the best app I’ve ever had! So I will give this a 5/5 anyway I hope it works soon <3
5,loveucoeren,"This is just perfect ! I would like the ability to replace overlays, otherwise this is my favorite app"
1,Samaiyrah,"0/10 i do not recommend.

3,•Yasumi_chan•,"It was a great app at first, probably the best free editing app I’ve ever used, but recently whenever I try to do transitions or add effects it says no connection and won’t let me do anything. Might as well delete the app."
4,zaydc,I love this app 100% but I feel like there should be more transitions and animation options. Also have different types of over layers.
5,~*Earthling_Comic*~,This app is truly amazing! The way it edits your videos and seeing other people how their edits come out! It’s truly amazing. All the effects and transitions are very cool! 😍

5,Milani's sentence,"This app is PHENOMENAL! It has built in effects, NO watermarks, and AMAZING transitions. I use it for my edits. Sometimes I use funimate but I use capcut too. So I REALLY recommend this app. Especially for edits or videos."

1,Reviewgirl13,"I saw an ad for it on Instagram, it looked cool because of the effects like the boom or the lightning bolt, but I tried it and I can’t find ANY of those things. I am VERY annoyed and angry. If you advertise what your app can actually do, that would be a whole lot better for everybody! I will NOT be recommending it! THANK YOU!😡"

1,fabledtongues,"Every time I import a new video, the beginning glitches visually. No amount of adjusting or splitting fixes it. I have tried dozens of videos and ones I have never had issues with and they are all glitching. Makes the app virtually unusable. Please fix this."

3,VanillaBeanBored01,The Capcut app frequently shows a ‘does not have internet connection glitch which prevents it from accessing tik tok original sounds. This can only be fixed by downloading and redownloading the app.

5,suskae uchia,I really love capcut but you have to bring back the soft effect it was a really good effect so please bring it back !
4,namemmt r,"so i’ve been using capcut for a while and it’s become my main editing app. but ever since it was updated (a few months ago) the text became all weird. whenever i want to make it smaller, it looks all pixilated and messed up. i don’t know how to fix it so i just use another app for adding text. other than that, great editing app!!"
4,drop that mic,I had many projects but the update delete them all but other then that it’s good
5,dark d-r-k derek,"I’m so surprised, I used to think it was hard, just by looking at pics. I readied the reviews  definitely download"

4,AJTheNinjaYT,"Don’t give me wrong I love everything about the app! My only problem is the key frames, they don’t have any easing curves. if you were to add that in the app, it would be PERFECT!!"
5,pghardy,Best free editing app out there!!! I’ve been looking for something like this forever. It works great for being just a phone app.
5,lilpink85,I love the app I love all the transitions but y’all should add for the next update a key frame for the speed and stuff for the transitions
4,hi im not saying my name,It would be way better with a Apply All option
3,Tomboy_StaEZ,first the good things: THIS APP IS AMAZING- I LOVE TO USE THE TRANSITIONS!!! I HAVR NO IDEA HOW TO USE VIDEO STAR SO THIS IS REALLY GOOD IN USE!!! now to the upsetting / bad things...: i have to keep on deleting things i need just so that i can edit. I deleted toomany things just for this. Im quite upste abt this. Maybe you can change that for  Me? TYSM!
2,julie the kitty cat241,some reason i can’t add anymore videos or photos it’s bugging and sometimes i can’t close the animations and then i have to lose all my videos and delete the app just so i can use it again can you please get rid of that
5,_user_sydney,capcut is really simple to use n all but i suggest putting more text animations. i know developing takes a lot of work so you don’t have to do this but whenever i do text animations my picky self doesn’t really think the animations go well with my edits. maybe include the video animations to the text animations?
5,Flappy the flatness bird,It’s a really amazing app and the thing I love the most is that there is no watermark and I really would recommend this thank you so much for this app!
5,imellatyegreat,This is so underrated! I came across this and I’ve been using it to do all my projects. It’s simple and actually works!

4,OShittalkingmushroooms,They need to find a way to share different projects with other devices.

3,xjilp,It doesn’t let me edit but everything for cap cut I have on and it keeps saying “in need of album” when I allow it but it’s a good app if I could use it
3,~TheCreator~,So when I try to edit I do down and it only lets me do it for 1 second so it’s not really an edit so it’s getting me upset because I can’t even edit now.

1,Aubreylishas,This is the stupidest app I’ve every seen I have to delete like almost all my photos and they are all memory’s I will never forget it’s so stupid how you have to delete all your photos just to make one single video. You should make a feature where it wouldn’t do that :)

5,Totally normal persom :/,"this app is really really good, i enjoy editing on capcut. but, i have a problem with the split option. like sometimes i’ll miss-split, do some editing with backgrounds to soon realize i can’t undo the split. please make it so that you can “recover split” or something like that. other than that, this app is great :)"

4,jfjdjdjfjfkk,They is there that we can to save texts in the element and use them a again and can you add a stagelight effect?
1,HightideSP,"The Style option was probably the most widely used feature of the app, and the reason why you’d choose this video editor over any other. I cannot recommend an app that actively removes its best features."

2,JODICHO,My friend introduced me 剪映。  So easy to use.  Love it.  One thing I feel strongly to use it is the PINYIN font.  It helps me to connect more people. I found us version 剪映， viamaker.  I’m disappointed the PINYIN font is missing for viamaker.  Many of my friends feel the same way.  I hope it will be available soon.

4,ghostbiih,It’s fine until I try to use graphs then the tutorial message won’t go away
2,Dog lover 90104,"I'm sorry, but the new updates are the worst, I have a great working phone so ik it not my phone but every video I make it's so laggy! And when i try to remove the background it gets rid of the whole image. Fix this capcut."
1,milky tea☁️🤍🍒,So right now I was editing and video for my friend Alyssa and I added one of the stock videos and I added some effects and it didn’t show up so I did it another time and the same thing happened again it was just a waste of my time 🙄
3,BoomShakalaka67,The screen goes black after a certain period of time in a video
5,dudethatistax,"It’s a very good editing app, just it takes up a lot of data storage"
5,i love this 😹,If you us graphs your zoom will like cancel itself out 😭
5,evenevenevenevenevenvene,The app is amazing and I love it and I edit with it a lot but we need motion blur to make them smoother so please? Can you add that?
5,laylaaan65,I love this app I’ve always loved everyone’s edits so I wanted to and I’m 8 (and a half) so it was hard but I saw CapCut and I love editing

5,sniperfoxbutnotwolf,"Honestly this is better than KineMaster because I cand do gacha memes, and do edits! Definitely recommend 10/10!"
1,gachamiku,I’m so sorry for the 1 star but when I’m doing a edit and I make it bigger it goes faster and I hate it! And when I don’t want the edit to be it and i redo it the photo section says Take pictures BUT I DID! I love the app though  but those are the problems I can’t work with
5,whxe,"Capcut is amazing with its overlays, and presets. One suggestion is adding graphs. Sure graphs isnt for newbies that just started editing, but it would make such a BIG difference."
5,Fate900,It is the best editing app that I think can do anything for free thanks capcut plz never update the free version it is good
4,AUBREYISGOOD,Can you make it that you dont need storage to make videos? If yes plsss i need it ima make an edit thats why.
4,helpmeplzimdyibg,Hey capcut you need to work ONk getting graphs and good turns like video star and maybe you can do more than AE and Vsp work on the slow turns
3,lucabobobo,"I love this app, but I would really like if it would let me edit without telling me that I have insufficient storage left. My iPhone can tell me that itself."
5,Fox 😺,This game is cool I like and I just download it it was very cool 😎 and it helps me a lot but I wish it had music 🎵 so good I like it and I won’t stop using it!
3,hygjyrftouhhkuhbhved,I love the app it’s a great editing app It has a lot of effects and there’s a lot .

4,B24553,"i really like the app, and how it’s nothing like video star. it’s really simple, and you have made it easy to edit your dream videos. the only thing that i would recommend is adding more effects because the few that we have are starting to get old. overall i give capcut 4 stars for overall design, and simplicity."
4,HunnyKisses,"I mean the app is good but, I hate how we can’t crop the videos how we want to, like we can only zoom in and out which is dumb, but it’s decent app tbh"
3,STOP NOW PLZ SHUT OFF THE ADS,"Its good but everytime when i use it and make an edit for my friend, it says i need to clean my storage. I don’t wanna delete the app but i’m gonna get another editing app cause this one i hate it."

3,PATRICIA #1 periotttt,i LOVE this app but there is one thing that bothers me so much. the overlay tool. it doesn’t work for me. when i click overlay on a maintrack clip to make it into an overlay clip it doesn’t work. i don’t know if it’s just on me or??

4,LE BANNA,I think it’s good and also no water mark it’s just that I can’t move anything
4,hfuyfuyfuyfuyfuy,"cap cut is an AMAZING app, it can do wonders. but my bling won't work, it says i'm not connected to the internet??? i am, i've been refreshing it, yet it stays the same. I really need help🚨🚨"

5,Aaron Beharry,Hands down the best video editing app out there!
2,Benny-27,"The last update removed most of the picture styles, including the 3D Zoom effect.  Why would the publisher remove these features?"
3,gfbckblll00,LOVE the app!! It’s an easy editing app to use and you don’t have to buy anything completely free it’s just that you keep taking anyway thing like auto velocity and it’s not cool
4,taylor12739,I love the app but the velocity hasn’t been working I’ve always updated it and never got the velocity yet.
3,Violetkaratemonster,Every other day Style keeps disappearing and I checked and I already updated the app and it’s quite frustrating

1,LUNI WE NEED GACHA CLUB,Takes to much storage! I delete 500 photos and I have to keep deleting the app and getting it back pleas fix this cuz when I want to make a video it tells me I don’t have enough store after I deleted 500 photos!
5,this is dustingly great,If y’all don’t understand I use this app for editing seggcy men like the kfc guy with abs and his shirt off idk what u thinkin 🪑🪑🪑🪑😟

5,kenzie•~•,I just wanted to say how I love this app so much! It is so easy to use and there is NO WATERMARK! It has nice transitions for edits and everything:) 5/5 recommend it!
5,Aaliyay willy,Can you add smooth slow mo like on VSCO I don’t feel like paying for it-
1,Hulu ads stink,I worked on an edit for HOURS. Then lost it all just because I accidentally clicked the wrong edit to deleted. There was no recover thing in the app. I’ve contacted the people to see if I can get it back and they haven’t replied. Utterly disappointed and upset.
5,tiktok leader,This app is really cool! You can edit on this Even with no green screen! I recommend getting it 100% :)

5,jshzjskjshzn,I honestly love this app I feel like it could be easier but it’s great for all of my edits!! I would give a 4/5!!!
4,mimi-dread,YES I love CapCut but they should have a feature where you can put more than one animation on a clip rather than just one.
2,I hate this game sooo much,At the beginning this was great but now that I have been using it more CapCut doesn’t provide what I need. I suggest that you select another editing software because this one is only good for intros and texts.
4,Ari.alba,"I LOVE THIS APP! It’s perfect to edit videos for tiktok 😆. I can add my own audio. But, I just wish we can have an option to make a folder 📁. Other than that, this app is GREAT 😊👍🏻."

5,CrayBlitZ,"I see the update about templates, but I don’t see any templates anywhere. Do you know why?"
4,GlveonMiami,"This is hands down one of the greatest apps in the App Store. No debate, but there are bugs that needs to be fix.   I have the new IOS 14.1 update and now many of the effects are not loading. I can’t apply it to the video.  It keeps saying no internet, can’t connect.   It’s frustrating.  Please fix.   Everything else is magnificent."
5,johannalovehebh,The app is really good but I really want that they add gif because is better to and I use a lot of gif🥺🙏🏻

3,LynnAvag,This app is pretty cool and I use it a lot. The problem is that the app by itself takes up a lot of storage and I don’t have enough storage already.
4,sam age 10,I updated the app but I can’t get the new effect I have seen people have it and I really want it but I looked and it’s nowhere
1,Fatima Chokr,So every time I try making a edit or whatever it tells me to go to settings and allow to save videos to camera. Every time I go to settings I see nothing so I go back and it keeps telling me the same thing! I’m very dissatisfied CapCut
2,Deezfans,sometimes when you need to press play it’ll stop and won’t play the video or when you got a lot of effects it’ll freeze. i really loved the app but this is getting ridiculous.
5,gastegastegastegastegastegaste,I really like this but if you added a green screen that would be great.

5,summerrashidi,"knowing that most photo apps charge for such big effects, this one has no “pro” and it’s great! no watermarks :P"
5,Merari cervantes,When will the style effect be on IPhone?
5,isaidabest,CapCut is the best editing app I’ve used. It doesn’t crash or lag. And it lets me cut clips way shorter
5,tjayy_24,CapCut if you add graphs your app will start to increase more than more before and it will improve the app by a lot
5,Layanna Johnson,"It so cool, it’s so much filters and I love all the stuff you can do on there! This is the best editing app! 🥰"
3,gjdkfnfkgi,This is a very good app but everytime I use it I have to delete it and get it back because it wont let me use pictures only videos!

4,k4vyy,i absolutely love this app and i always use it. but i was making a vlog and was almost done with it but i accidentally deleted the whole thing. it is my fault for deleting the vlog but it would be great if they had a recently deleted option so you can go back to ur edits just in case you deleted them:(. other than that it’s a good app<3
5,Itsaubreymehta,it’s good but I suggest if they made more transactions that slide left and right like how the pro ones are
5,jsisjsjaj,Can u make the text thing have animations like go ones please
5,bddhdjjx,I love this app so much! But it would be nice to have more animations and filters like in pro editing
5,chr1stmus,Can you add some edgy shakes. I really enjoy the app but I wish it had a way bigger variety

5,Sunflower owl,"This is literally a LIFE CHANGERRR, I absolutely love this app, it’s 100% free, and you can edit sooo good!! It’s amazing!!! Totally recommend!!!!!!!!  🤩😍😁"
3,iloveroblox12131415161718,I really love this app of the way it edits and it makes it easy but I don’t really like the new update cause you cant use different animations now and it’s really hard to work with.
4,Rafpops,The app works great but sometimes it acts dumb. It starts to lag and completely messes up your edit.
2,shejjsjdjejsmemvrkwmsr,So at first i loved until I noticed how the transitions were it took a while to get to the next photo they should update that and they don’t have a lot of stickers or no search for the stickers thanks please see this
3,light rocks,Good app but the bling effects never work and I have no idea why when I press on them they say no connection or something but every other effect works
4,lhgkxkgxk,"Look I love Capcut but today they removed STYLE, style helped me with a lot of my edit and maybe it was on accident but I’m so sad it’s not there, please Capcut add it back"

4,malupa30,I can’t tween with my ocs and with ur auto velocity thing never appeared in style or anything but on TikTok everyone else did please fix this :<

4,H/MHz.m.,i love how capcut looks in the editing process. honestly this app would be perfect if it had the effects and transitions after effects provided. i do love how easy it is to cut clips and make some great amv edits. it just needs some more high end transitions and effects that could compare to a high end software.
5,Heathmazing_2010,So my friend told me to download this and ever sense i did i have been using it non-stop! Ty for creating this app!
5,chrolloscumeyesock,With many free things other apps can’t do capcut is by far the best app I’ve ever edited on

3,lovelyafton,I’m a little good at CapCut the reason why I gave CapCut 3 starts it’s because when you have a amazing idea to do on CapCut and then it say iPhone storage full witch really bothers me
5,boiiiiii15,"This app is so amazing and very easy to use, so many great features and fonts!"

1,the...capcut...girl90,OK every time I go on the app I try making a video for TickTock it’s saying I have to delete some and then I have an I delete one but then it tells me to continue deleting and then I keep deleting and then I had to delete all of them like what’s wrong?!?!?!!?!!!!!!!
4,mochijimin95,I just recommend adding face distortions. If it did have face distortions then it would be a 10/10
5,Swirl Rose 𖦹ͻ,"CapCut is perfect for a beginner in editing, and still good for people who aren’t a beginner. It’s got basically all the stuff you need to make a video- Effects, text, stickers, filters, audio and more! You can even import your own music if you want. There are no ads and the app is 100% free, which is a great deal, considering that it does have a ton of different features all in one app. I saw lots of people complaining about the insufficient storage thing, and how even after cleaning out tons of storage, well, that is a mystery to me because I guess I have a lot of storage? But it’s almost used up yet I can still access and create videos? Even if it is so, you could always just delete some more stuff, right? Or maybe I’m wrong, but anyways, I love how they are constantly adding new additions to the app, and I’ve noticed quite a few were requested by the reviews! :) I love that. Most people are saying how it still needs change. I think it’s already great, but true, it could always have more, I suppose! And the watermark you can remove very easily as well, which is amazing. And also I have an observation, I think it may be a bug or glitch or something, but I feel like this is a clue to a new feature CapCut’s gonna have. So, sometimes I will play the video back to myself to make sure it looks and sounds fine, or I will go to my exported audios and choose one I wanna add to my video. When I do that, the audio starts to sound different. The difference between the original and this other version is that in this version, if there were voices in the audio before, then the voices are all gone and it’s all instrumental! But then I play it again and it’s back to normal. So that is pretty interesting to me. What are you up to, CapCut? ;) But yeah. That’s pretty much all I have to say because I’m too lazy to write more. Thanks for finding this in the sea of reviews and reading it to the end."
5,*uclsjsjyzbsjzizz,I love CapCut bro like it helps me do edits and has really cool effects good blur and the slow-mo is okay plus it’s free y’all should really download CapCut.
3,MAD GIRL! !!!!!!!,This app is awesome! But why does it keep saying CapCut need to be connected to album and it is!! I said confirm and it brought me I To my settings everything was on ! Idk what’s it talking about!”
1,shawty shawty potty bae,"this app brings so much anger into my life. it makes me want to rip all my hair out. #1 it doesnt save anything, i had an edit that took me ab 3 hrs and i exited off of it. when i got on it again IT WASNT THERE. i ignored this problem for a while until IT DID IT AGAIN. this app is so bad tbh   sincerely,alice trunchbulls fav"
5,lazz884,I don’t usually write reviews but this one deserves it. Prolly the best editing app on the app store
4,Jazz 🥳,I’m on a iPad it’s just to much space But I love all the stickers  It helps me edit my yt vids So overall I do recommend
5,123456789hdgvxg,We just need more to effects
3,Mermaid Blossom,this app is good but it could be better. these are probably a long shot but i’ll still suggest it. so you know how keyframes work and such well i was think that you could adjust the effects with key frames. like how you can change the sharpen settings i think for example you should be able to do that with the blur effect.
4,Arson lowery,I love the app but I wish the slow mo’s were smoother if you can fix that it would be awesome good app overall!
5,❄️luna,This app is the BEST editing app EVER!!! 5stars for sure! It’s the only app (for editing) that’s not app in purchase! And it has so many cool features!

1,Creative Violet,"Ok, don’t get me wrong. This is an AWSOME app. No watermark, tons of effects, transitions, and more! But this thing that bugs me the most is how I need storage, when I clearly do. It really annoys me. I’m so tempted to delete this app. I’ll change it when I’m able to go back in the app. That’s that."
5,jyamada76,THIS APP IS COMPLETELY FREE WHICH I LOVE! This is very good with editing and it doesn’t even have a watermark which amazing and it’s very easy and amazing for making edits!

I tried redownloading, turning off wifi, updating to 2.0.0, etc but nothing works. I’d like to give it a higher rating bc it looks cleaner than funimate, but I can’t.   If someone knows how to get rid of this issue please let me know!"

3,it wS,There’s pros and cons I don’t like how there’s like once you make a lot of vids then you have to delete a lot of apps that all but overall it’s ok

1,M.@r6858476347855,"When it comes to choosing effects, they take too much time to open or download. Download can be slow but the thumbnails of every effects don’t open all the time."
2,DaiVDai206702,"I’m very upset that every time I’m trying to save it, it says insufficient something it’s annoying it’s saying my storage is full it’s super dumb I delete everything it’s so annoying."

5,ukhaylin,Is slow mow a thing
3,biscuit lol,"i overall love this editing app and he has so many useful things it can do when yr making a video but theres one thing that i hope can be fixed, so when i put in a video capcut will trim off some if the video on the sides and ruins the whole video and that really bothers me so i hope y’all can fix that"
3,shanthi m.,When I want to do transitions it always says check ur internet but my internet is good
5,SaraR :),"I do love the effects, animations and etc. But I do have some recommendations for new effects.  Effects: Flare, ice cold, steam, mountain glacier."
5,i luv slime,My graph won’t work but I still lov it
3,hedienekid,Capcut was good but then something happened. The overlays were glitching and wasn’t making my edits good as they did before.
3,prevete,I’ve been using Capcut for ever and the sound is starting to be very glitchy:/ please fix this.
1,Yall musty,“CapCut needs access to the album for editing and editing videos” literally all it says when I wanna make a video how do I fix it :p it’s really annoying
4,spacejame,Suggest: can you guys add like we can access our music in our files
5,cami!💕,"Hello!, the app is amazing but I think that you need to put the slow motion like vsco , but the app is amazing 🤩 ty"
5,colemckeever1234,You should get this it is totally free best thing I have ever used
1,hello neighbor 3D,Your app made me delete everything in my photo memory when the app says you have to delete some photos and come back! I did and I still says that! I deleted 359 photos already that where my memory! Your evil
5,klopkggff,My 3D zoom effect won’t work can anyone help?
4,STOP TAKINF MY NAMES,this app is really good the only thing that annoys me is that when i try to make something it says “insufficient storage” then i go to delete like a bunch of my photos and i deleted my other projects and it still says that but other than that i like it
5,JRCML,Amazing and so many features
3,𝚖𝚢 𝚘𝚙𝚒𝚘𝚗 𝚕𝚘𝚕,I’m sorry can cut but your new update is a lot harder to use. As an editor I liked the old set up but do you.
5,Owl_YT,I love CapCut it’s so helpful. I would really recommend you use this app. Thank you CapCut!
4,Dangan Weeb,"This app is poggers!!! Its great for edits and theres alot of features! My only gripe is that theres no   custom transition type thing, it would be really useful"
5,totitoheart,Amazing editing app there’s so many different things! Highly suggest this app!
5,| A Weirdo |,Hey great app! Its hard for me to use tho any tips on how to get better?
5,PNYtracey,I wouldn’t change a thing about it. 😁😁
5,dusmsoa,LOVE THIS APP ITS AMAZING. But I would suggest adding a feature that allows writers to control the speed of the effects
3,55500546,"I haven’t looked into it much but I haven’t seen a thing where you can cut out middle sections. I know you can trim it, but that cuts the ends and not the middle"
2,Tomi Arakaki,"After I edit a video and make another one , the video clip’s screen goes black and I can’t fix it for like 10 minutes. It keeps happening"
3,shidjfghc,When I edit my video I can’t save it it says I have to delete some photos and I deleted 120 of themAnd it still doesn’t let me save the video... I got so MAD
5,MoonaWolf23,"I love this app! It’s so amazing!!! So many great features! I just have a few suggestions to add to the app. More camera movements. Movements where you don’t need to do a “animation” and the camera is just moving or shaking or swaying like an effect. Just more movements! Camera movements brings life to the project! Also more richer filters. Maybe a filter where you can have only specific colors show and the rest is black and white or a different color. I would also like to do zooms in certain areas. You can choose where you want your camera to zoom and how much it will zoom in or out. More transitions as well! Maybe interpret the zoom effects with transitions but you can also have your own zooms put on top of the video (like an effect). And more lights like “leak 1”. The leak 1 is great, but I would like more like that. More lights that move around the screen. Different colors and movements. More lights for “effects” but also light movements on “transitions”. I would also like a bit more creativity with the text and typography. Maybe even make the camera follow the text. I would also like for more customization with audio. Maybe you can make an audio clip sound more static or sound if it’s coming from a tv. Overall great app, and I would love if the developers decide on adding these features! :)   To sum up the features I would like added is: more camera movement (as an effect), more creative typography, richer filters, more lights with different colors and movements (like leak 1), zooms as an effect and your choice of placement for the zoom, more audio customization, and more professional looking transitions (not the cheesy type)."
5,Recker10,This app makes things easy. Anyone can make good video edits with this app.

4,Rubyoffical,This app is pretty good I use it for velocity and other things but it always take up storage

1,UltimateAce004,I have video clips with audio that continue making noise after I cut the video shorter. There is no way to stop the audio from continuing into the next clip. Extracting the audio does nothing

3,Chlo63923,It deleted my project that I have been working on for hours and it just was not a very good experience
4,pluto🐽,"ok so starting off, im in love with capcut it's so easy to use. it comes with a ton of effects for free and all the stuff u basically need. a downside though, the slomos are choppy. they're low fps and the app doesn't have the best quality. just a suggestion, motion blur would be nice, graphs, and a cleaner slomo. everything else is perfect though"
5,broccoliUwUerror,Hi all I’m gonna ask is can you add more effects 🌸

5,aominexd,It helps with a lot of editing I just got it but it seams really helpful
3,beer is great,"i think that a great feature to add would be the ability to delete a singular spilt when it is no longer needed by tapping on the spilt and a button you could press after tapping the spilt to delete it, this would really help me out a lot and i’m sure others would enjoy this feature as well"
5,Mariella363,Now I can do funny videos (: highly recommend.

4,anavie412143,Okay this app is great but really really really really really (9 years later) really really (702 really later) glitchy. That’s all.
4,babshshsjks,So for the slow mo its so choppy so could you maybe fix it a make it smoother ?
1,haianaibjwk,"To begin with, I saw you put a new velocity edit overlay thing and I wanted to try it out. It wasn’t letting me do Styles or it didn’t show the velocity so I deleted it and updated it and it still didn’t show."

1,AllieBri5,"i try and try and try but I just can't get it to work i haven't even passed the first page because whenever I hit the ""confirm""  button it does not let me make a video"
4,tessssssmmmmmmm,"I’m very happy with this app. I have been using it for a year now and have been able to make great things. There are a couple features I hope can be added. First of all we need to be able to add multiple animations to one clip. Currently I can’t fade in and then fade out the clip. I also can’t fade out a clip that has a fancier animation. I would love if i was able to favorite animations and apply the same animation to all clips. I would also like if the speed tool was better. Currently slowing down clips is very glitchy. Another suggestion is to add more font choices, especially ones similar to higher paying programs. It would be great if I could import fonts. You recently updated the camera focus effect and blur effect so that you can speed it up and add more blur but it’s still not the same. I would like for it to be able to look the same for shorter clips as I use that a lot. This way I can make edits that look more professional. I would like for me to be able to add multiple colors to the chroma key. I would like to be able to add multiple effects and animations to text and clips. And maybe something to improve the quality of my videos. Those are some of my recommendations. Some of the fonts show the fonts in another language. I would like for all of the fonts to be shown in the language i have set on the app or phone, for me English. My only other criticism is that it can be glitchy. Sometimes when I try to watch my video it pauses on a certain part and unfreezes later in the video. Although I do appreciate the lack of ads. In conclusion I do love this app. Please look at my suggestions I believe many people would benefit from them!!"
5,Chupas 🍆,The day I downloaded cap cut I did 14 videos 13 adopt me and 1 grain he’s a famous YouTuber and I wach him A lot this game is fun

2,csefsrffs,It was a nice really great app but now it costs money and stuff and it’s super mean and now I can’t edit my videos ;(
5,Pradaninja,Gets great job done.
3,DBGs LLC,Stop! When your done with your video don’t click that share button just yet. Here’s why… After doing 2 test projects. And looking at the add-on effects. I have decided Three stars. 3 stars are rare for me you should feel good about this it’s not to bad . 1 star because it’s fairly decent. And another star for ease of use. Another star because the logo can be removed on your phones editing software.  I did not rate this 4 stars because it has locked out features I couldn’t test. I didn’t rate this 5 stars because it has a logo at the end of every project. Which I hate the most and would have rated it 1 star. My biggest peeves on ANY item doesn’t matter who the company is and I’m not pointing at anyone. But I hate on any product of whoever it may be at the time I hate locked out features and logos.  Based on if I’m doing a something important to show for school or something for work the end logo could fail the project. OR locked out features could be the key of adding that special twist that I couldn’t get. So I wouldn’t rate it for schools or work. This solely based at Home Use Only. And that is where this product really shines the most in my book. What I’m saying is you can add videos from anywhere just don’t use for school or work. If your doing projects on major stuff the logo will be it. But this is removable IF you use your phone to edit that out. If you do that. And only if you do that. I could see it cleared for school and work. If they remove the auto logo appearing at the end then it just might rank up on my favorites list. But all features must be unlocked with no logo to make that list. It IS on my recommendation list. So try this out. Don’t forget to cap out that logo before sharing it places.
2,imamgery!!,Had it before all the til timers came now the shove the logo down your throat

1,amanda sibien,I don’t have the templates option
1,taylor23444isreaL,I’m so mad why’d you guys get rid of velocity that’s pretty much the only reason people used the app
1,ilovefoogsjwnwjj/&/&,Why take away the style option that’s literally how I made my videos for tiktok
3,bgyhdjdjdurh,It's an easy app and perfect  for  new editers but they  removed  style😖😢😭
5,WoopWoopHidroFlask!,"This app is well put together, with an easy to navigate system, so many features and options, and everything available!   1. First off I’d like to point out how excellent the system is. Every option and control is easy to use, forgoing overwhelming amount of possibilities. At first I was concerned that some of the options (e.g. speeding up or slowing down the video, adding effects and animation, adding text, cropping the video, or transitioning between clips) would be impossibly difficult to implement, however once I (quickly) learned my way around the app I found it was extremely simple! Usually these kinds of editing apps confuse me and make we want to punch a window, with all the complex options with multiple options off those options. Options on top of options!! (See! I probably made your brain hurt just thinking about it!!) Differing from these mind boggling systems, CapCut provides so many options, but arranges them in a system I find easy to learn, simple to navigate, and fun to use!  2. Second, I’d like to applaud you guys for not including a subscription, extra pay add-ons, or limited features which require an upgrade! When I first opened this app I instantly assumed I would be bombarded by “Pay for this and you’ll get that!” “Get premium and get all this!” Or “To get started, begin your subscription!” However, I was met with a pleasant surprise; no subscription ads! My brain then began to ponder what I would have to pay for. What was the catch? I cautiously began to use the app, expecting something to pop up saying “now you have to pay!” But in fact there is NO CATCH! After getting the app, I didn’t have to pay for a thing! How exciting is that? Thank you for not creating a subscription-binding app!!!  3. Finally, I’d like to thank you guys for your hard work in creating such a pristine app. The effects are smooth and clean, without the unwanted fuzziness and glitches. I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality edits I was able to implement. The amount of money people pay to get high quality editing tools is insane! Yet you guys give us  an easy to use, high quality, all out amazing editing app for nearly nothing!   In conclusion, I’m in love with your app, and I can’t wait to use it even more! As there’s always room for improvement, I would suggest just a minor addition; the option to cut the songs down (maybe this is already possible I’m not sure) but every time I add music to my little short videos that are like 10-12 seconds long, there’s always an excess of song at the end, leaving me with a lot of blank space. Allowing users to cut down the songs would be awesome and greatly appreciated. Otherwise, this app is really cool, and I’m proud to be a user!  -Thanks! -Darkpuppy, age 14."

1,leronrt,Why is my text section in Chinese someone please help
3,jsisysbsksushshs,"Problems I encountered:  1. A limit on animation; it would be nice if there were more options with animation, but a problem I encountered as well is that there aren't matching animations, for example: Yoyo 1 only goes to the right direction. I feel if you're going to make an animation that goes to one direction there should be another that goes to the  other direction as well, like Yoyo 2 should go to the left, (Including other animations as well).  2. In and Out; I also believe that combo animations aren't enough, In animations and Out animations should be able to work on the same clip together, not just one per clip.  3. Overlays; There shouldn't be a limit to how many overlays someone can put, it might be because the app starts to lag a bit, (which is fine, I’m still able to edit), but then you should be able to fix that issue in order to allow a person to put limitless overlays.  4. Text; Whenever I animate a text, for some reason after a while of editing it stops doing the animations it's supposed to, for example: I put sunrise animation for the intro and slide down for the outro, but it dissapears after a while, so I have to tap on the text and exit it again.  -Another issue with text (similar to the In and Out issue) the In and Out of the text should be able to function and work while I have a Loop, so, the Loop can start after the In of the text and stop when it's Out.  5. Transitions; Mostly a specific one, and that's the Slide transitions. It covers up the beginning of the animation of a clip.  6. Less than one second; unable to put transitions on a clip if it’s less than one, I feel as if that should be doable.  Ideas:  1. Adding keyframes, this could help more with the creativity on the app.  2. More transitions, for example: splits, tiles (tile shift/tile rotate)."

4,Uwyejdnanbqknfo,"La app es muy buena en sí, tiene sus efectos y todo, pero por mi opinión como Editora: cuando hagamos slowmotion haya una opción de ""Optical Flow"" para q se vea de calidad y de altos FPS con una opción de 500/1000FPS. También estaría súper bien que añadan más tipos animación como las de ""After Effects""; por mi lado no sé usar esa aplicación, pero estaría bien chivo que pudieran poner más opciones de animaciónes para la satisfacción de uno. Una última opción es q añadan en el apartado de ""Efectos"" más efectos con temática a ""After Effects"" para una mayor experiencia profesional. ✨"

Tengo internet, actualizo el teléfono, apago y prendo el teléfono, borro cosas a ver si es que tengo poco espacio y no cambia nada. Entonces el problema es la app y no mi internet ni mi teléfono. Por favor arreglen este problema, ya que no se como solucionarlo sola, y la edición es mi única entretención. Espero lo arreglen lo más pronto posible. Gracias y buen día."

5,i HATE thIssss GaMe,This a great app also thank u for capcut because I’m making a YouTube vid with Capcut!
1,the person 123654,I had capcut before but I deleted it then I tried to get is back and now it’s saying to pay umm nope I am not paying for that they should make it free for every one they can say whatever they want but I am not ever going to get capcut or even mention it to someone .Why are they charging us for something we are going to probably delete in future I am not saying everyone is going to do that but maybe some people just us it a little then delete.so what I am saying is that if they want more and more people to download it they better make it for free.
4,gr ryn rgn,"I go to camera to do some filters and I realized that nobody has changed it. I like the green screen but I have a few things to ask you. Is it okay if you make the video more clearer when you set the video slower? I don’t really like it when it’s not smooth and so glitchy. The other thing is can you add the waterfall filter? If you can’t, it’s fine but if you can, it would be wonderful because I seems so much fun to do. I love the time warps scan and I keep doing the angel ones. I don’t like the wind tunnel is appearance because it doesn’t work. If you could fix that, it would be great. I made so much edits with this app and helped me make more to Roblox videos and some turning red edits. I also make funny videos so I can send to my friends. But if you can add and fix the things I said, I would love it! 5-19-2022 at 6:11pm :)"
2,TheHarpieQueen,"I’ve been using this app for over a year. It’s followed me through my successful TikTok career and through my transition onto YouTube. I’ve never had a problem with it until yesterday.   I’ve been working on a video for about a week now, then suddenly the app crashed. I tried opening it back up but as soon as I tried to open the project I was working on the app would crash again.   I haven’t been able to access my project since. I’m super disappointed bc I needed this video to be up and now it seems I've lost everything.   Any help to get my app to work again would be great."
4,MissEVbean,I love cap cut! But it has recently been very hard to edit and nothing will move or work correctly for me.It’s has been a problem also because everything in the sound is delayed.
5,anthony duartes,This is easy and fun to use I make videos for YouTube with this app and it’s amazing I recommend this app
5,sub to LuvlyBella on yt,"I used to use capcut for all my Roblox edits I posted on youtube and I used to post them on tiktok. It’s really good for beginners. Once u know how to edit, I recommend video star or after effects."
5,sixela.locd,"Tiktok/ insta  @sixela.locd  See my CapCut work ^^  Y’all are doing it right !! I don’t do reviews but I had to for THE CapCut ! So many good things about this app. All I ask is don’t change in a negative way. I’m broke don’t make me pay. Ofc the app could add little filters and etc but the work they put in already is enough for me . I can’t ask for to much,  it’s a free app !"
3,Queen of Love🥰🥰🥰,"So, I have had this app for a while and I just finished an edit of a YouTube video. I am working on the cover and I save it. The whole thing resets to what it was before I edited it. Like what the heck of course I am sitting there upset because I can’t post the video. I spent 2 hours on it and all the progress gone. Like I said great app but that made me a little upset."
2,Ugggghhhhhwhy,"So my Capcut app updated recently, I’ve a professional editor with a successful YouTube channel, and now I can’t even edit properly.  The audio decides it doesn’t want to line up. Then when I scroll back through my selected clips, and it’s glitchy. Nothing works right now and I’m very upset because I love Capcut so so much."

Also if you respond to me do t say I have to uninstall the app I have over 70 videos on there and spent hours editing them.
4,chrushelemccrf,So I have Been having some issues on this app.Style is not showing up I was wondering if I used it to much because that was my first time using style and please just fix it CapCut .
5,Hello-kitty gal,It might take a bit to learn how but YouTube and TikTok have plenty of tutorials on shakes velocity and coloring and honestly I am in love with this app the only thing I’m dissatisfied in is how late my CapCut takes to update sometimes.I’ll see new stuff on TikTok sometimes but I have to wait longer until I get my update for some reason
3,єνєℓуη,WHY DID YALL TAKE AWAY STYLE I NEED THAT IM MAD I QUIT CAPCUT I RLLY THOUGHT THAT YALL WERE A GOOD EDITING APP.bye capcut!
4,Daly dose of life,"Hi,I have been using CapCut for a long time now.it has made great improvements and helped me when I was a beginner, And when they added the auto velocity a long with the other things in the “STYLE” category I was thrilled.But when I wanted to try out the new update…IT WAD GONE! I am very sad because it made edditing so much easier. So please capcut bring back “Styles” :(."
4,ALittleWeird,"This truly is an amazing app that I recommend for beginners! It’s free and easy to use. It does whatever any other editing app can do just for free. I do have a question though, what keeps happening to the “styles” button? Whenever I click on the video I need to add styles to, it’s not there! I tried updating the app, closing out of it, and deleting some things from storage. What’s going on? The styles button is really helpful to me when editing but it keeps disappearing! If you see this, please respond what I should do.(and yes I tried looking for tutorials on YouTube) Otherwise, thank you for this amazing editing app 😊"
5,velocity lover,Please add back the velocity style back pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee it was such a good help for my edit🥺😞
5,littelnamy 5,"so I was editing a video and I wanted go add velocity, in order to do that I had to press a button named “style” unfortunately it was not there, I thought I was doing it wrong so I looked on YouTube, still no-not there I had been using this for a major while with no problems i then checked if I needed to update it I didint. What is this problem? Idk maybe a bug but still cant find it. Overall its a really good app and I do recommend downloading it bc this bug is most likely not to come across from. Thank you for your time. Developer please respond. Ty"
4,yo panda is rapping,So I have a YouTube channel but it’s not very big right now and I’m trying to make more videos but I can’t because I have this installed and it takes up so much storage I was at 4.1 storage now I’m at 5.1 I am very mad but otherwise it’s a good app 😡😡😡😡
1,seriosuly bruh??,"i have been using capcut for god knows how long, but i clicked into the app today wanting to make an edit with velocity, the style button is no longer there, ive done everything that i can to fix it and have spent hours looking on google, youtube and tiktok and i have found nothing. nothing has helped even though there’s been videos i’ve watched. they’re all the same thing. i’ve uninstalled and reinstalled the app, restarted my phone, still nothing. i miss my style button. i can no longer fast edit because of it 😊. i hope to god that it’s just a glitch and that it’s fixed soon. as much as i love the velocity it seems to add extra beats aswell."
4,Seangmaers373,I used capcut for a few months and it’s great everything is free but their is only 1 problem because it takes up a lot of storage and I don’t know if it will let me upload vids on YouTube because it can’t export but this app is still good
1,jfndoenfksmrkfkamdm,I saw some YouTube videos and they have anime filters but for some reason IPhone don’t
5,I eat pasta,I love this editing app.it’s easy and nice to use . I also like how everything is free and works really good. I really really recommend this app for editing
5,Parker Baranski,I make YouTube videos and I love using this app! Keep those updates coming!
5,ECX ScultxrsyYT,This app is the best for my YouTube channel
5,22344578,I love to edit poop😊
5,XD 2314,"I use this app for edits. (I used to use Kinemaster) It's a big upgrade from Cute Cut, or Kinemaster if you're looking to edit. I think this app is perfect where it is, it's completely free and there's no limitations to what you can use. The presets for animations, transitions ect. are really good. And as a beginner at editing, this app really teaches me things. There's even a speed ramp if you make edit audios! There's filters you can use on photos and videos and overall it's a great experience. No matter what skill level of editing I recommend it."
5,dhdgvxvcxccvdv:/,"I love this app so much it helps me with my editing for my YouTube channel! But I would it if u guys could add a galaxy background it would really help and maybe some more songs and affects, but overall it’s an amazing app I would recommend getting it!"
5,Kevin86974,This app is a really good app. I have a few suggestions for you. I want to see if you can add motion blur to CapCut because every time make an edit I need motion blur to make it look better. Second is I want to see if you can add more transitions for the combo animation like AE (After Effects) if you look up AE edits you will see on YouTube. This app is really good though!
5,Bsdww,"I don’t write reviews but this app deserves it, I use it for Tiktok and YouTube shorts and it saves me so much time, I prefer using it for short type content vs using Adobe premier which makes the process a lot more time consuming.   Love this app and it is a gem !"
4,Michelle._.thedxmny,"I love capcut i really do. Its how i edit my youtube or TikTok videos. But one little problem, and i hope yall will fix it soon. I wanna edit my videos while listening to music. But every time i try to listen to music on the app capcut, the music stops. ( I listen to my music on the app Spotify) Please fix that soon. Thank you 👌"
5,urgirlashley,I think this is a good way to start editing if ur a beginner!!!When I saw this app it was so easy to use!!And really easy to explain.Go check it out💕😁
2,Alice Mathews,"Capcut is great in all but I got rid of all my photos to free up space but that's not I got rid of,also I got rid of my games but it said ""influential space.please free up space for capcut to work"" like I don't have anything so what do you want me to do?So to all the people who will get capcut please be aware that when it says that just get rid of the app I'm just teling you that it might happen,hope yours work,again Its just a warning"
1,vaxson5,when i trying to upload overlay and than click to remove background it doesn’t working. i tried download again but it still doesn’t working.pls help and fix this bug
5,LinkusTheDinkus,"Yeah that’s right! My YouTube channel was doing HORRIBLE using iMovie but when I use CapCut, my subs go way up! Any2ays, this is definitely 5 stars. Nothing wrong with this app. No bugs or anything!"
5,bella pepper2950,"So I LOVE watching Gacha life Memes on YouTube and I wished my parents would let me start my own Channel, One meme I watched ended And said CapCut and I was like “CapCut?..” so I searched it up and got I and well… This app is the BEST! I make Gacha life videos to save to my photos and watch them at night! This app Instantly helped me become AMAZING at editing videos and photos. Thank you and I hope this was helpful Lol (Also I’m not a Robot I’m a human being)"
5,WorkinMomOfTwo,"I have used this for sooooooooo many tiktoks and YouTube videos( go sub to Gacha MangoCake btw) It is just amazing for anything you would like to edit. Being completely honest, I would change NOTHING about it. It is just really awesome."
5,Henry Bacons,"I might sound goofy but this app is so well created…. I’m horrible at editing things and like every app I tried is just poop, I saw CapCut on TikTok and decided to try it, I don’t regret a single thing, it’s so easy to find the things you need for your edit, it has everything you need. props to the creator!!!"
5,gamrgrl!143,"Love your app! 10/10 would recommend if you are a YouTube this will help a TON! It’s amazing me and my friend love it so much! BUT TO THE CREATORS! Auto tune would totally sell it! Adding the option of auto tune to your app would be awesome! Thanks! Oh and lastly everyone that deals with this minor issue and I would love some extra storage on capcut, when I make a certain amount of videos it doesn’t even let me watch the videos if I don’t delete some....😕. But still I love CapCut!"
1,hay1721,DONT INSTALL THIS STUPID TRASH SO BAD YOU CANT IMPORT ANYTHING THERE ARE NO EFFECTS AT ALL I HATE THIS DUM GARBAGE F U CREATOR GRRRRRRRRR
5,dray2865,cap cut is a really fun app to edit stuff.Its a beginning for making cool new videos and more! I accidentally deleted it but then im reinstalling because i love it sooooo much!!
4,Tʜᴇ Rᴏʙʟᴏx Gᴏᴅ,I LOVE CapCut but I have to go to Google to look for templates and other videos! I just want it to be on iPhone and on US Service Phones in general!!!

5,❤️❤️say so🦄🦄,So I’ve been having CapCut for awhile and I really like the app it’s great for beginners and also pros everything just got this new update it’s been a lot more smooth and better effects I really like the new update but I do have some suggestions I feel like you should add like more transitions because I would really like some new transitions because it might just make your videos look smoother also I would also like more stickers because those are kind of old just to me but other than that it’s such a great app I really recommend it it’s very easy to edit with and I can’t edit with any other app LOL so I do recommend it for any beginners and if you’re a pro or you know kind of know editing better than a beginner I think this might be the app for you but even though it’s really easy to use I think it won’t be the best for pros because I think they will find it too easy and also they might find it too boring because there aren’t that many effects or that many stuff in the you know the like catalogue really great app I’ve said this 1000 times in this review but I really recommend it for beginners and it is very easy to use and you can do as many drafts as you want it’s much easier than KineMaster I got it in me a lot because I am not that pro at editing LOL I mean so you should probably download this app if you are a beginner because it will be really easy for you and you can also upload them to YouTube and TikTok I think other platforms do that but I just think it’s an easier way other than copying pasting yeah and that’s it for my review it’s pretty long but I think you should really download this app it is such a great app trust me😊
5,Aves412 (8 years old),Even tho I don’t do YouTube or tt I love this it’s the 1# editing app for me!
5,unicornplxys,This helped a lot people say it’s hard but it’s easy but some problems when ever I have no internet and I go to favorites it said I have no favorites but I do.this is a good app
5,azalia 🖤,IT STILL HAS THE STUPID BUG WHERE IT SAYS NO SIGNAL EVEN IF I HAVE SINGALONG IVE DELETED AND REINSTALLED IT UPDATED IT I EVEN WATCHED A YOUTUBE VIDEO LIKE THATS A NEW TYPE IF LOW anyways please fix it i bet it’s a great app IT JUST WONT WORK FOR ME
4,username 04,"Like I said, love it. The only issue is, I normally listen to music when I’m editing, but this app won’t allow any background noise, whether it’s spotify, youtube etc. You have to edit in silence. Please fix this issue :("
4,*-🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋-*,"Capcut has been very useful to me! I came across capcut on YouTube and decided to download it! So,I got it, and what I learned was it is superrrrr helpful to beginners! It’s easy to learn and you could delete the watermark for free! But there is something that I would like to address. The “no storage” feature. I wouldn’t really call it a “feature” but it is a feature in the app so I will call it that, anyways back to what I was saying it is super annoying especially when I press the plus button to import the pictures for a video it says “no storage” or when I record music for a video and press the plus button it says “no storage” it is very annoying because I keep deleting so much of my apps and data. I almost have no more apps anymore! I only have 3 actual apps and those are for animating, editing, and drawing. Please I’m begging make it not need so much storage if that’s even possible! But another problem that I have is the slow-motion quality. It is definitely not the best but it’s not worse then some I’ve seen. Even when I put “smoother quality” it doesn’t really look like it. I use a different app for slow-motion because of this problem. I’m not saying it’s a major problem and I might be the only person complaining about it even with the new update, but it’s just my opinion and you can always get it if you want! There is one last thing I would like to address. The chroma key. It is not the best at making things transparent… for example there where two totally different colors I used for text and a background to import in one of my edits and while I used chroma key the white disappeared with the green? I don’t know if that was a glitch or I’m color blind, because those are two totally different colors. I have no idea why it did that but I had to just go with a different color! Please fix that, it was annoying because I spent time on the text and it just erased and went transparent and blank in the end. By all the things I said so far where just tiny complaints that I have. So, I’m not here to tell people what to complain for! You should definitely install this app if your a beginner. Like I said in the start very simple and easy to learn from! But you don’t need to if you wouldn’t like to! That will rap it up for my review! I hope anyone who read this far has a good morning/evening/night!!"
4,KmSso fan,So first thing you should probably ad is searching for the type of sounds you want to ad to your video or photo.Witch would make it a lot Easier to find instead of scrolling and scrolling. And that’s all that’s it.Lol
5,(•̀ᴗ•́)و strong gurl,"I love this app extremely because of the no ads, no watermark, and no memberships! I found this app surprising to me, and I have been looking for a app like this for a year! I have some questions about this, When will new transitions come out? But, I am so happy about the great features! I have a YouTube channel, And I have subscribers because of this! I amThanking CapCut for this amazing editing app! Suggestion: Mirror sway. edit: i made this one year ago and now i use videostar om 💀💀💀"
5,roblox is nice to have!,"I’ve been used CapCut for about 2 and a half years, I edit my videos with CapCut for my YouTube channel. I’m very happy that I found CapCut also it’s very easy to use it’s not to complicated like other editing apps!"
4,~•Yarrow•~,"Hi! I have been looking for editing apps all the time and realized that a lot of people have used CapCut. So I downloaded and it was perfect! I would have rated it a five star, but the review only made it to a four star review because a few weeks later I decided to make another video on CapCut and I tried the animations of in a out and it wouldn’t load no matter how long I wait. One time I waiting for at least fifteen minutes and still didn’t load. The fonts didn’t show either, and all that other stuff. I was stressed out, so I checked my internet to see if I was connected. I was. In facts, my internet was really good and had all those three rows and stuff, I don’t know if you understand. But anyways, my internet was fine, and I updated the app too. I went back in the app after the update and yet still it would do the same thing. I even shut down my phone and went back in, watched YouTube and see if anyone could help, and even tried going to settings and try stuff out. None of this worked, and I gave up. I’m not sure if this happens to anyone but for me it’s really difficult to handle.  But overall, this app is a really good app for editing and making videos, and I made awesome edits with this app. The options for editing are endless and fun, and CapCut isn’t that complicated as the others."
4,Kelrun,"I love this app so much! It has so much different things you can put in it. Different stickers, or animations, etc. But there is a few things I can say. The effects can get a bit crazy at times. And sometimes this app lags for me, which makes my edits glitchy. Even now my edits are a bit blurry and glitchy. But one thing I love this all the new effects they are adding! I just love how they are taking the time and making new effects. I know on YouTube, everyone loves it and is using  them for their edits! Capcut has become so much more popular. I use capcut and video star, and capcut is so much less complicated. So basically I would just work on the glitches and lags that happen in your edits or videos you do! And a tip for the people who are new, try not to use so many effects at once, as it will look crazy. Otherwise, this app is great and great for people who are starting editing!"
5,willathechilla,"This is the best app ever! I’m on it all the time and you can use it for things like, memes, gifs, funny videos, normal videos, YouTube videos, and of course ROBLOX EDITS! CapCut is sooo easy to use yet it makes every video perfect! You can use audio it provides or you can chose your own music by eaxtracting it from a video you have saved! This app is so fun and you can name your videos, duplicate, and if you want, delete! CapCut improves all the time as they add new features! If you open the app and click on “camera” it takes you to where you can record or take a pic and it has fun filters and effects you can use WHILE recording in it! It’s got like Snapchat but you can’t socialize or anything! It’s only filters! This app is appropriate 110%! I would say 7+ is best! I do have a few ideas that would mean so much for you to add! 1. Better watermarks 2. New effects, the ones we have are getting old 3. My videos glitch when I am watching them in the app so please fix that, when I send the videos to other and watch it through our messages, it’s not glitchy, it only happens in the app. THANKS SOOOO MUCH FOR READING! BYEEEE! (RECOMMEND THIS APP)"
1,@nobodyisathing,"So I've been using CapCut for a year and now it's really pissing me off. I'm trying to use chroma key, but the eyedrop thing or whatever it is won't move. It also won't let me select my clip. I've retried and reloaded the app many times now to the point where I'm really feeling I need a new editing software. Capcut is very laggy and you have to exit it and enter it back to get an iPad screen. (Or any other non-phone devices). Overall, CapCut is NOT the best editing app and if you were looking for a experienced editing app, I'd definetly NOT reccomend. Thanks, bye."
2,thefriendlyone,"This is literally pissing me off. I loved CapCut until now. No matter where it is I go, it won’t work. It says I have no internet connection when I literally do. All I want to do is add a slide down animation and then I’m done with my project but it says I have no internet connection. I’ve tried checking my connection, re starting my device, updating the app, delete the app and re installing and even looking up YouTube videos. But nothing works. Please fix. ASAP."
4,noraBrooky/norabora,"Ok. First off, I'm not putting ANY hate on CapCut because it rocks and I definitely reccomend it for new YouTubers. But if you want a song like ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"" then you have to go through the whole process of extracting the sound, despite the fact that all of the other music is from Tiktok. And you can't upload directly to YouTube. You have to put it in your camera reel and then upload it from photos. Otherwise, this app is perfect. Developers, if you're reading this, please jump at the opportunity to fix these issues. But otherwise do not touch a thing. CapCut is close to perfection. If it weren't for these issues, my rating would be five stars. DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT'S THE BEST.   -CapCut user"
4,Rosexi198,"CapCut is the Best editing app that I’ve ever used ,but it can use some improvements. This happened to me three times ,so I was just about to make an edit on CapCut when a button popped on my on my screen ,and said except ,so I pressed it, but it deleted all of my edits ,and at that time at I had nine edits ,so I immediately raged and deleted CapCut , and waited till I was done with school.Then I came home and I got CapCut again ,and it worked.So,the second time it happened ,and this time it didn’t just take after school ,it took ,like a week ,so I got so mad until I finally decided to use it. This third time happened to me a few days ago ,so I was making an edit and now I’m a pro at CapCut ,and I had 31 edits when I came in the car to make a edit ,guess what it said except ,and I tried to look if there was an cancel button, because I knew that button was evil ,it was up to something ,so I press the button and guess what, all my edits were gone. But, luckily I got them back so,CapCut please do something."
5,Zbanks600,I say this a good app because they are good to edit skits video music videos vlog videos for my YouTube channel and yea
5,the queen of mac& cheese,So I just made my first project and it was so good but I didn’t see YouTube but I still love the app bye!
5,calaber69,"I love CapCut, it’s a good editing app but there isn’t enough music. You can connect your TikTok account to the app and it’s cool but just not really that good. I don’t know if there’s a reason why you wouldn’t be able to but I was thinking like what if we could connect our Spotify account, search, pick what song we want, and cut out the part that we want up to maybe 3:00 minutes. It would let us pick any song that we want and still let us edit the song as usual."
5,nXova,In just a few minutes of having the app and reading some of the reviews this app was amazing it helped me so much and was so easy and simple If your a beginner and need help with maybe a YouTube channel or a TikTok account this app is the way to go.
4,zee mae,"I love CapCut so much! On other editing apps/games it is very complicated to do. I learned how to use capcut’s editing tricks very quick! I didn’t need any help or tutorials. CapCut helps me with my editing I do for gifts and other things.CapCut can effectsdo,sounds,filter,movement, text and animation.I learned more on the buttons witch was very easy, CapCut tells you where to do that movement or effects. But the only thing is that sometimes there are effects CapCut doesn’t have,so I have to do the hard way. Making the effect my self. I suggest to add more animations because I always use the same things"
5,PushtheButtonStudios,"As a Long time Pc (Adobe Premiere ) editor, I finally made the switch!    Before there was Capcut I would have told you from endless downloads on ios and android, that Cell phones video editing was inferior and lacking any real potential of replacing professional PC and Laptops editing.   I would have said applications will not reach the potential of programs.    Capcut is the only app to convince me otherwise!   Heck premiere cannot even motion track.  But this editor, strives in every category, pushing every boundary. Except One, resolution output. 1080p output is the only weakness.    But this technological archive of an app programming feat Is FREE. and it is the best there is ( payed app or otherwise ).    With that said, I submit the following; I have only ever payed for ONE app and it was for Professional control over the stock iPhone video recording functions.    I would happily pay for my 2nd time ever if … Cap had 4k and 2k format output.  If I could suggest three updatable features it would be:  1. in app frame capture with at least 1080p screen capture output. ( not freeze frame), output frame to gallery. for making video thumbnails. This feature would make this app and all in one solution.  2. External access to music a side from itunes music/ folder. ( export audio from video is an great feature).  Like some of your competitors a file browser function outside iTunes is the final feature to put this amazing app on par with computer program based editors. along with a frame grab feature.  3. Layered video effects per layer. example: I use the Incredible background remove to create clones. Much like the ability to splice and change parameters of a layered track, this would add video fxs exclusively applied to that layer like those found on the main or top layer video (the magic wand 🪄 icon).   With these features this app would surpass the work flow only possible across 3 adobe programs. Premiere for editing, Photo shop for thumbnails and After Effects for motion tracking and pre track eccentric video effects.    Frankly I argue that the stock materials like stickers and motions base text and animation, has already surpassed they stock materials across all 3 adobe products.   Hundreds of costly third party plugins are need just to provide the stock materials within Capcut. Including; stickers, fonts, sound effects, motion animation, transitions, and video effects. (which are still only available in apps).    Final mention;   The [style] featured (possible on freeze frames) effects like what is referred as picture morphing parallax. (called [3d zoom and 3d zoom pr… within this app). IS INCREDIBLE.    No other attempts made by programmers have even come close to what is pulled off automatically by these features.  Same can be said about the [remove background] feature.    Thank you, from a full time video editor  who’s workflow now consist of %70 percent Capcut, %30 PC."
5,taethree,This app isn’t that bad after all.after I saw legendary edits used and made with CapCut I’m very surprised I’ve been using the wrong all along so this app isn’t so bad if u give it a chance.
5,BeachyParis,I’ve been using CapCut for about 1 year now and I LOVE IT I’m so happy everything is free and u can remove the watermark for free unlike other apps!BUT I have a few suggestions!Mabye add a free QR code area where u can add QR code effects that ppl can make or take from video star my point is I know how to use CapCut but not video star and I would like for u guys to add more video star like effects!!But besides that this is an amazing app 100% recommend
2,theBrokeBoy,I give it a three star because I don’t have access to my saved sound. I tried on both my android tablet and my iPhone. Same result. Aside from this inconvenience the app is really good.
5,Duraku 😎,because its free and it has alot of thing that you can edit and its a great app like i have been using this app for like i don’t remember because it have been years months days and i have been doing alot of capcuts updates and this app is getting really good and there might be somethings u cant find but if u cant find but it could be that u havent done the updates and its just that this app every day is getting better and better i cant imagine what would i do without this app and there might be alot of free apps but just because the apps say its free it doesn’t mean that ween u open the app ur just.gona edit like no it will say u have to pay every month like no capcut it’s better because it free and u can do alot of edits and ween i first got this app i was like what do i do? but then I realized that u had to try ur best and if people dont like ur edits well they’re just hater that hate on every edit that people make and most of my edits go to tik tok❤️❤️❤️❤️i love capcut
4,midnightdonuts,"Hello ! I have a issue with CapCut when ever I go in CapCut to make a new video , it’s says : “CapCut requires access to the album for editing and saving videos” idk if this is a glitch or somthing you guys added but please fix this if it is I’m very sad right now because i LOVE CapCut is my favorite editing app I’ve ever had in the past please fix this if this is a glitch and if I have to reinstall my CapCut I’ll very sad because I have made a lot of videos on there that are special to me.Please help."
1,santimvf09,I made a video for my YouTube channel testing it out and it made all of my clips terrible. I would call this the worst editor ever. They might look good on some platforms like tikok but try uploading on YouTube or any other social media and the clips look like they are 360p or an even worse quality. Only thing good about the app really is the animations and effects. I wouldn’t recommend this app at all.
5,Kesah88,I am Absolutely obsessed with CapCut!The Effects are everything and I make the best edits on there!The best thing about it is that it’s completely FREE!!😮‍💨🥴It’s also way better than KineMaster Especially since you have to pay for KineMaster…I’m Just Saying if I ever make a Gacha video they are Fantastic when I use CapCut!!!!My Youtube is Kawaii_sun if you want to see how calcite effected me🥺🤩!!!
5,Hicfjctjhf,"I really do like the app. I am able to make edits and post them to YouTube and everything. My only thing is, I wish there was an option to be able to remove background music or sound from a piece of audio or video. If that could be added or implemented in the next update that would be terrific. All around great app though!"
3,@queenparish,it ok I used cap cut a long time but now it won't let me save the long videos that I make for YouTube and I had to make a whole new video because it wouldn't save & they need to add so new stuff the things they have is getting old I don't want to keep using the same thing the only good thing right now is that it free so I not to mad

5,hyjhtfbnufnktrevh,I love it it made my friends so happppyyyyyyyyy PS.make the song we don’t talk about bruno byeeeeeeeee. Ps.I’m a kid
2,gachawierdbean,"So i’ve been using capcut for a good couple of years. i’ve notice that the app says 135.4 mb but in the storage option in setting on apple says 3 gb, PLEASE FIX THIS IF YOU CAN!!!!"
5,lolo jamica,I love how there is so much stuff to do I use it for my Roblox edits in YouTube but maybe add some more stuff to it but still THE BeSt EDiTInG ApP Ever
3,Pieris And Natasha,"Every time I add about 3 affects it gets glitch and delete them. Please fix this bug!! Otherwise! Great app! I have made a YouTube channel using this, please subscribe to it if you can! - Kxlaz-Xdit-Wxrld"
3,corra sun,I would like to add that whenever I try to use an audio from tik tok it always says no internet connection or something along the lines of that and the only way to fix that is to delete the app which removes all of the edits I have done.The only good thing about this app is when it works
4,Dexterrrrr0,"This app is amazing. It’s great for making edits (as I am an editor), but I just have 1 suggestion. Add.A.Motion.Blur. kind of like Video Stars so editors who use capcut can make photo dump edits without needing Vsp or TimeCut. Thank you :)"
5,Ayden j Hernandez,At first I didn’t know how to use this app but then they made updates to make it easier it’s a really good editing app that you can use to do a lot of stuff with.Overall I give this app a 10/10!
5,greywolf7100,It’s free and you can start editing right away it isn’t that complicated once you get the hang of it. There is plenty on tutorials on YouTube and in the app it self has videos to help you understand what certain tools are for  just tap the “?” Icon and you should see videos .
4,sucksterribble,"It’s very easy to learn as a beginner from CapCut but the thing is,It gets way to easy and you start to not knowing what your doing.So if you are a beginner I recommend starting off on this and if you feel comfortable stay on it and if you dont, get a new editing app0"
5,3xclusive._,I LOOOVVVE THIS APP. YOU CAN MAKE AMAZING VIDEOS AND EDITS FOR FREE AND NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR ANYTHING.OUT OF ALL THE EDITING APPS I HAVE TRIED CAPCUT HAS BEEN THE BEST☺️.
5,LuvMelisa_Yt,I have a YouTube channel and it blew off and I only used this app and it went great it is soo easy to use! I love it you can get any effect /sound effect add overlays and even more! I have came so far with this app!
5,Aaron Baren,The app is great and I recommend for beginners and people looking for an editor for TikTok or YouTube shorts. First there is an apply to all but could you have an apply to all for the Animation feature for the Text. Number 2 you should have more stock videos like you know I stock videos or anything really. Number 3 I think it would be cool to add stock PHOTOS or in the stickers add photos  I hope this helped!
3,VannessaD,Is the auto velocity effect only on android? Can someone tell me why my CapCut says can’t adjust current clip? Also can whoever owns CapCut add the auto velocity effect on iPhone too I really want it.
4,JAYLIKEE,I updated CapCut but I didn’t get the slow o everyone else got.Everybody was doing it on android but I have iPhone so yeah.I just need help can anybody respond back and help me with the new update I’m trying to get to 5.0.0 but I have 5.42
5,Dhruv N,"This app, Capcut, is amazing. Amazing. It’s free! And you get most of the features from paid competitors. Yes, some drawbacks (need more fonts) but that’s minor and there’s enough for most occasions. The app is easy to use, and there is so many features! I used to use video shop for YouTube, but I downloaded this, and I am much happier. Download it! Easy to use and feature packed!"
5,EDMaesGamer,So I see all these thing on YouTube and tiktok where your able to have all these different tabs and your even able to sign in with tiktok and I have none of those and I’m on an iOS 8
4,😺catboycam😸,"Hello I hope you notice this but you said a smooth slowmo update would happen on march 14 2022 (yesterday) but I didn’t get the update, if you did not add it to the tablet device please do (if your still working on it for tablet just tell me when it’ll be released) thank you! (Also I want a motion blur update)"
5,hey its me lin,i got this app bc i have seen it all over tiktok and stuff and it works really well i make edits for my bf randomly and send it to her and this has help me a lot! thanks cap cut!!! ❤️
4,ghcyfbsb hsndg kdnd,So this is a good app for editing but there is a glitch for photos.When you go to add a photo or picture into the project it says you have none.And I know this is a glitch because the photos were there and then they were gone.Please fix this.
5,leooooo✨✨,It’s so good I make my edits like 24/7 365 on here like omg and it has great quality!✌️
4,AcVoidFNF,"So, I definitely like this app. I’ve been using it for maybe nearly a year now to make videos for my YouTube channel. I’ve been able to make really good animations with this. However there is one thing that I wish this thing had that would make this so much easier. I make FNF-based animations so there’s a lot of looping, specifically for stuff like the idle animations and parts that repeat. It would be very helpful if there was an option to select multiple photos and copy them so I wouldn’t have to put more work into doing the same part. Other than that I think it’s a great app"
5,storms-x-x,I started making YouTube videos NeededTo edit themThis is great for me because I am a beginner 5Stars!
5,okgggggg*fynndjdhxebd(d,I love this app with all my heart and I think it needs to be the number one app please write to my comment…..so basically when I try to make my text glow (which I know how to it doesn’t work I tired millions of YouTube videos to see what is wrong (what I did wrong.  AND I DID NOTHING WRONG oops caps sorry I am a kid and maybe you can fix it please -love by fan
1,consumed.soda,"When I got the app again I tried using the TikTok audio it said I had no internet connection when I did. I look up YouTube videos to how to fix it but they they really said is to use a a vpn. If I really need to use a vpn on an app that gave me the option before hand to use the audios, the app is just not worth it to me anymore. Sorry."
5,snakeseeee,"I use it for tiktok videos and youtube videos, and it’s good quality for tiktok making it. I also love love LOVE how they made velocity so we don’t have to spend hours on velocity. I also like that diamond star thing that you can you to make charecters walk! Amazing app."
5,MrR0b0tGuyHD,"This app is amazing. It’s perfect for my YouTube channel because it allows me to make editing look so much better than IMovie. And it’s all free! I only ask that you not pull a Spotify and make it cost money in the future, as it will definitely ruin the app. Overall great app though!"
1,kyanisjf,CapCut your app sucks🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
5,lucXe,"I really use capcut a lot because it’s really good and easy to use , but at first it wasn’t ,so I had to use YouTube to help me ,and now I am a pro at this , this really and might get me to have many views and I love this app so much but it some sort got deleted and now I can’t download it but I do really recommend this app because it’s really cool but it might get really confusing, just go look at YouTube, it can help solve it and you will get to know lots of new things on capcut and the more you use it or practice you will be a master at editing on capcut ,I am just hoping one day I can finally download it back again because I love it sooooo much , please use this app!!!"
5,@keke.world,omg ok so I have been using CapCut for 2 years in a row and I love it so much I have a YouTube channel and I edit my videos like about every day and I love it 😻 so I promise this edit app is the best one
5,pro_baller24,"This app is awesome and I use it all the time to edit random videos I’ve taken or to make cool montages or even just to edit a pic to make it more exciting! U can add music, sound effects, filters, camera transitions, text, and even add a different background (without even having to use a green screen)! This app is perfect for everything whether it’s to edit a video and upload to YouTube or TikTok or just to find something to do while ur bored it’s a perfect choice and it’s all 100% free! Do urself a favor and download this app, even if ur not really into this kinda stuff usually, it’s always good to have just in case!"
5,awhlil,"this app is so amazing for edits! I love it so much. So many things you can do with this app! It’s awesome! It’s awesome for your YouTube edits, tik tok edits, ect! Totally recommend."
5,Cali and faith,I have been looking for an app that would be free and this is best the filters voice changers the way you can add your own audio you can also export them to tiktok YouTube Facebook I think. And send your edits to your friends!
5,mincraft is wow!,"It’s a Really good editing app to use for YouTube,Tiktok and more, And if you have a YouTube channel You can use CapCut And I think it will help your YouTube channel , I don’t see any problems in this app, It’s perfect!"
4,SonOfYsf,"Can you make the overlays stick with the clip like the stickers please, so when i move my clip the overlays moves with it exactly how the stickers do so on the app, because it takes a lot of effort if I have more than one overlay and I want to remove certain clips or shorten them after I added the overlays it takes actually hours to do so because I edit my YouTube videos on the app, this app will be so perfect if you guys add this thing to it, it will laterally save us more time and will let us only use the app and not other apps with it, also if you guys can fix the Arabic issue because when I write in Arabic actually the words gets typed in backwards so I can never type in Arabic if I wanted to add a title or subtitles ❤️ rating: (9/10)"
2,emma hodges,"Idk if this is happening to anyone else but when I save an edit I made to my camera roll, the music and the pictures don’t line up.and it’s so frustrating.I’ve tried everything,I’ve tried deleting pictures, using a different app to record things, deleting apps.nothing works."
4,Hi.I.Like.Fnaf.,Could you maybe make a place to search videos like YouTube ones and we can save them? It would be great since I’m trying to make a green screen.
5,lexythegamer,"When I downloaded this app for the first time it was fine, but now it’s just starting to be a pain in my butt. It would make ten thousand excuses for you to not use this app first is the “insignificant storage” now is not letting me edit any videos that I can upload to my channel I’m slowly starting to not like this app anymore… (I had to give it five stars or else it would hide my review)"
5,Good but scary and fun!,I am not an expert at editing.But it is still very good.So if I were you I’d download this app.
5,baoaooaoaoaoaue,This app is amazing when I first started I thought it was going to be FILLED with adds but no I was VERY wrong it had no adds and then I thought it was going to be like HEY DO YOU WANNA BUY THIS 999999.999 DOLLER SUBSCRIPTION and Same thing nothing so everything is literally free you should get it
5,Kunoie-San,"CapCut is great for editing making vids and all but one of my problems are is that ,whenever you want to add a gif you can go to stickers but it doesn’t always have the ones you want so if i do want to add one I have to go to google and find the gif and download it so it is kinda annoying to do so I was gifs options.Andsecond thing is sometimes in overlay you cannot get the pictures options and only video options.Andthe third thing is that whenever I try to make an edit audio and I get the audio but it gives very low options to edit it it is mostly like speed,fade,delete and whenever I give the speed slower it doesn’t come out as smooth and I would really like a few audio edit upgrades like backgrounds music,reverb,underwater,and more like that And that and the fourth thing is that whenever I remove the green screen with sensitivity but the results don’t come out as good and plus give a drawing option with a nice amount of types of brushes so Please fix that if you can is all I have to say and I really appreciate your work but adding the things I told about would be ELITE and I highly respect and appreciate it.That’s all I have"
5,ᔕOᑕKᗰOᑎKEY8,"CapCut is a great editing app for videos. I use it all the time, it has many cool transitions and effects! The effects might just be my favorite about the app! CapCut also has very good aEsThEtIc music for background. CapCut also has good fonts! The only thing that I don’t really like about the app is keyframes. The keyframes are very hard to use. I understand perfectly how to use them, but my object always moves around wear I don’t put it and it slides a lot. There are tutorials on YouTube showing how to different stuff! I found out how to do a rainbow outline and it works very well! Love the app I recommend the app very much"
2,ambernoriega,Ok so it’s pretty good but every single time I need to do a YouTube video it’s like 25 minutes long and then it takes out my audio of me talking I hate it please fix this it’s so annoying and when that happens I have to download it again i really don’t like this
5,galaxysaper,"This app is like the best editing app I’ve ever seen. Everything in this app is amazing, and everyone should be downloading it. The auto velocity made my edits 100000% better. This app just gets better and better by the millisecond."
5,Annie Bananie_Playz,"I am new to CapCut but I am getting better at editing my YouTube videos. (My YouTube channel is Annie Bananie_Playz#roadto35subs) CapCut has lots of effects and I like that you can also put a frame around your video but, if you zoom in, you can’t see the frame. That’s something you could work on. I like the filters and all the transitions like the glass break. I think that you could also add more like instructions on how to do it at the beginning because I had to explore it and that toke a little while. Other than that I think this is a good editing app for people to use!"
5,Tres King,"Me and my friend have tried a lot of apps for editing such as KineMaster, vn, iMovie, FilmoraGo  and the list goes on. We have a YouTube channel *if you are reading this sub to tres prod* and we post sports highlight edits. CapCut provides many different effects, transitions, and animations.   *I have a few effect requests, which are projected custom text so when you add the effect you can change the text, a blue shockwave because the other one is getting overused, and lastly and shake animations like after effects  			Thank you*"
5,Mockumentary,"I love this it helps me make such cool videos! If you want to see some of them my YouTube channel is called sky pheonix check it out if you want! Also I give this app a rating 1000000,0000000,000000,000000,0000000 out of ten"
5,Dreamiuf9,"Highly recommend this app if your new to editing like me. It is super easy to use and easy to understand how to navigate through the transitions, effects and edits. If you get stuck you can easliy look up a tutorial on Youtube to understand."
5,londonado13,"I love this app. Right now I’m making text to speech. Anyways, I’ve never found anything wrong with this app and I just adore it! Btw, my brother has a YouTube channel called GlowCat. Make sure to go check it out please. And thank you if you do."
5,CApCUtuser,"So I have just started YouTube and my friend recommended using CapCut so I tried it, when I first used it Overall it was very easy to edit and I did not have any problems. But when I finished my first edit and downloaded it, I had to delete everything to download it and post it and it also took a very long time to download. But this is one of the best editing apps I have used and there are some of my suggestions."
5,its good and fhn :),This so is very good I had a video and wanted to edit it so I typed up edit and I seen this app so I downloaded it and added the video and added edit.The edits looks really good with this app capcut if a very good app for editing.
5,youtube: -brookie-cookie-,With out this app I would of never followed my dreams i will repay you I swear when I grow bigger.thank you so much😌
5,Elchampin,This is the most amazing editor app I have ever used! I have been using it since 2020! It’s an amazing app but the full storage thing is kinda annoying.But besides that it’s amazing!
5,onale7,I love tjatvthrush
4,{Aoi_Lolly},So I been using capcut for a year and I been using the graphs thing and when I go to use it it seems to be not working like how I remember it was working if this is a bug can you please fix it.No rush if it is it’s just werid to me and if it’s a new update it’s really cool just graphs
4,luna caluna,"I have been using CapCut for a few months and I really like it because it is free no money.no premium!!, except for one thing. Whenever I try to do slowmotion it lags and doesn’t have good quality. But I do recommend this app!!"
1,K4800SHK33,after effects >  - namikaze.aep
4,gfbffgsfhh,This app is great for editing a lot of things but what I normally use this for gotcha.Ot is great for that but I think it needs a few more things but over all it is a great app to use.
5,kkolivia sds,I make YouTube videos - Olivia Lamora- and I edit with this they come out so cute and amazing without having big ads and watermarks!! Thank you CapCut!
5,💜Bri💜,"I’ll admit, I see why this app has such good ratings. I thought this app was overrated but it’s pretty good for its ratings and reviews. The animations the music, the sounds, everything is really high quality for a free app. My only problems with the app is that 1 I’ve seen a lot of people on YouTube are able to look at other peoples edits on the app. I’m not sure how to access that. And the chroma key, when I do it on a certain color it does it for another color as well. I think the issue might be with the intensity. Other wise, it’s a really good app."
5,robloxgamingdumer,Yo.you made a god edit for me?
5,Supernova3695,Very easy to learn. I like editing YouTube videos and it’s perfect
5,Layla~123,"Honestly it’s one of the best aqua I have had and it’s so cool you can do so much on there like make videos, edit things, and even edit your own videos it’s a really fun app and I think you can enjoy it too but there are some difficulties but from now to when I was a beginner I think I kind of masters this app. You can also post your CapCut videos on YouTube, TikTok, and maybe even instagram. I totally think this app is worth it."
4,IvyRages^^,"So, recently I started YouTube (1 year ago). And, lately I’ve been using KineMaster. On the other hand my friend has been using capcut. I don’t know but when I saw her edits, it was so good. I downloaded capcut and I didn’t know what to do at first but she taught me and I watched videos on what to do on capcut. Once I got better at it I started posting even more. But, I saw that some people been using other apps and they have animation. I loved the animation so much! I tried putting 3 animations in together by splitting one picture / video and.. it didn’t look as good: although, the app is very easy to use like what it says.  Now, I kind of want features to come in and I love the new effects they added but I just want more animations. Not just effects, but animation. I also want them to add this button where it says “Change Image of buttons” I want this button to change the picture of the “Create New” , “Shortcut” and “Camera”. Now, I really want my capcut to look really kawaii and cute. Although, i don’t want to edit it because that’s gonna also get rid of the words so, I really want these features to be in capcut. I’m sure a lot of people would want to have more animations into the app and some people would want to also customize the buttons. 💗 But overall, the app is really good!  (Please respond back: I need answers!)"
5,whoskofii,Anyone want smoke dm me @whoskofii on instagram I’ll whoop up on u🥱
5,Blossom loves roblox,I love this app I always use it to edit it’s not complicated to use at all you don’t even have to watch a tutorial it’s just so easy!  I also use this app to upload a photo on YouTube I don’t have 500 subscribers so I can’t just upload a picture so I put my photos in here to make a video and then I upload that this app is the app that in the future will help me edit my YouTube videos really good like others Do you can also put clip together in this app which is really popular I think this app is the app I will never delete I love this app sometimes there are bugs but they are easy to fix alot of times you just have to get out of it and get back in I can always count on this app to help me with me edit love it!!!!!!
5,nilblack,"Found App by “Created by Ella” young YouTuber. It’s free, easy to use, and kills time. Fun app making Music Picture Slideshows for Apple Videos and YouTube."
5,Sprite leader,"This app is amazing! I use it for all my edits and its a good app for beginners but theres only one problem.And its about the quality, when I adjust it sometimes its not smooth and I’m looking for something that can greatly increase quality on videos.so this app is great but only just one problem for me.Thank you:)"
2,Elita E.,"I really loved this app for a few weeks. I was using to edit my YouTube videos and I never had an issue with it until today. Randomly it started freezing and and now allowing me to edit any further. My video is less than 30 minutes long and I have plenty of storage. I tried closing the app and restarting it. And restarting my phone as well. But it just keeps happening and now I can’t continue with my video. Idk how to fix this, someone please help."
5,whateverjsjsja,"I was looking for video editing apps to start my youtube channel, but all of them costed money, and “pro features used” would come  up exporting the video. But CapCut, no no no.. it let me have freedom and creativity while editing my video! It had so many cool features FOR FREE!! I am very suprised with the outcome and results of this app. Thank you so so much for making my video editing experience better!"
5,JEYYCLERK,I've never been this appreciated for an app.100% and no watermark are on the whole new level.Thank You creator and looking forward to the best new features in the future.Well Done.  2022 REQUEST : Can we have Myanmar Fonts available please?
5,Chanman614,It is the best free software I have ever found and I use it for YouTube and YouTube shorts.  It is wonderful the only thing I would like to see is music editing to that would be amazing even if it wasn’t that great of a software. Thank you for reading!
5,Yosley_1988,"Excelente app para editar nuestros videos caseros y gratis! Creo trae más opciones que iMovie! Muchas gracias a los desarrolladores.  Update: 30/1/2022 Hello, it is not a problem or error that I want to tell you about.  I would like that in future updates of the application they add the possibility of being able to import audio clips directly from the iOS Files application, it is a function that I think is useful and necessary.  The VN app allows you to do this, so it would be great if CapCut included it as well.  Greetings and thank you very much for the work you do."
5,rose9008,Good
4,♡sofi ♡,Amaizing for making ticktocks and for YouTube but pls more effects like for the lighting lighting effects and bling and for us to use the same background from a photo or video thanks
1,gfgghjghhh,Fgggytttgg. Hi
3,#AmazingGacha,"If there is anything I get made about it’s when things don’t work or are glitchy. I really want you to fix it and make sure it’s fixed! I can’t even play it or upload it to YouTube! I get mad easily too, and this does not help! Overall it’s fine nothing much/different. It’s just that it won’t play like you SAID it would. And, it was MADE to play a video or to make on to watch and play. As a small YouTuber, this does not help that I can’t even make a video to upload! I want to see my finished result. Please please please fix this! It just makes things 10x harder and makes videos much harder to make and watch! Please!"
4,❦𝚐𝚘 𝚜𝚌𝚑𝚘𝚘𝚕❦,Yes it’s a very good editing app it helps me with all my TikTok’s YouTube videos etc.But when I delete most of my apps it still says phone storage I hate it o deleted half of my photos and still said phone storage I hope it doesn’t do it again to me because I deleted half of my phone I am not trying to be a Karen I am sorry if I hurt your feelings but whoever wants to get an editing app but the other one make you pay money for things get capcut it’s free and amazing!Thank you have a Blessed day
4,DankTerrariaCreeper,"More filter options, please I need a way to make videos deep-fried sometimes. Also, add support for gifs."
5,Aiden Avila goz,It soo good I like it for tick tock  it’s soo cool it makes your own videos better than the old ones it’s like you are an editor like a YouTube or a movie editor
5,Jordan4ever2011,"This app to be honest,IS AMAZING LIKE LEMME TELL U K SO-in my opinion this app is really good especially for beginners. And yea like if ur a Roblox YouTuber for example CapCut will be great to like help u edit and stuff (sub to me on YouTube my channel is Simply Flame) but today it was kinda laggy ig like when I tried making a new project it told me try again later and sm about my internet..I’m 100% sure there was nothing wrong with my internet Like all other apps were working so that means my internet was fine.Um so yeah basically if they could fix this problem that would be great! 👍🏻"

4,Littlepeypey77,"I love this app so much I’ve had it for a while and I use it all the time but there is one small problem. I like to make edits using the app and I put my username in white with the opacity to 10 so it’s just visible, but I can no longer change the opacity. The bar to edit the opacity it’s blacked out so I can’t use it."
5,FireaceXbox,"I use this for my YouTube and tiktok and it’s the best editing app ever. No label, no adds, and good quality app"
5,FrostCA11,This app is very simple I could even make a YouTube video if I wanted. I’ve always stuck to writing but because of this app I so simple I’m so happy. Give it a shot seriously!! I use it for my Tiktoks @yourdarksideguide
5,pony lover❤️❤️❤️,"So I play a lot of roblox and stuff like that and I see people on YouTube making edits and I saw one person used CapCut to make their edits. So I decided to download it and try it out myself. All I can say was that I was AMAZED. It was so easy, and a little time consuming depending on how long you edit your video. But my first video turned out amazing!!! I currently have 21 edits so far and they’re amazing! So I recommend you to download this because a lot of people use this app for edits. So yeah! Hopes this helps!!"
5,T-150ZIL,This app is really good I always use this is takes some time but it helps me make youtuber videos fast and in peace it always helps me to make my videos and it doesn’t even table that long I give it a 5 stars and 10/10.And it even let me take the audio super fast and I can make the videos before my charge runs even thought I am an iPhone user😊

3,heiheitoby,I think this app should connect with Spotify so I can have actual good music because your thing to connect with tic tok does not work other then getting the video on there I can’t have my sounds on there
3,dnddhud,Capcut it is pretty cool and I can make good edits.I also connected it to TikTok.But it keeps saying no internet when adding TikTok sounds.And keep having to uninstall then reinstall the app.
4,da cute ryleigh,It’s great but.... I NEED REAL MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!! So we need real music not fake music but it’s good ෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆෆ╹ .̮ ╹ෆ¯\_(°_°)_/¯¯\_(°_°)_/¯
5,sweetflamingo12,"I love this app! The only thing about it is the music. I wish that you could search up songs. Let’s say I wanted to do a video with a tiktok song in it. I would have to screen record from YouTube and imported in there without hearing it. It makes it hard to know timing. As of I’m old enough to have Tiktok but I’m not allowed. That’s the only thing that I would like to have because everything if perfect in that app! Also if you import a sound for the video can it give us an option to put it along with the video or have it separately when the video is done. That’s the in,y things that I ask for ! Again other than that the app is amazing TOTALY RECCIMEND!"
5,44 good,This app is the most recommended editing app (please read this whole review) my sister first recommended it to me and I thought it would be a boring app where all that you could do was take vids   But I started a YouTube channel and I used it for one video and everyone liked it!

5,aimeechavarria,"I really love Capcut, its overall a great editing app.  My only suggestion is about music What i kinda wish for is to get music from ITunes, Apple Music, Spotify, or we could even transfer the whole song  But overall its really great and I recommend youtubers, streamers, or anyone who makes videos to get this app!"
4,YourMomsBloodVessel,"This is a pretty good app for beginners! Before I used to edit with KineMaster but ever since I came across capcut on tiktok I have improved a lot with my edits! The only problem is it kept saying I had no more storage, I would delete so many photos and videos sometimes even apps and it would still say I had no storage.to fix it I had to delete it and redownload the app! Here are some things I want on capcut that I think would make the app better: smooth slowmo,more fonts,more than one animation on the fonts,a option for good quality,more effects,and more animations! So in conclusion I would say if you’re a beginner I think this app would fit you! It’s a pretty good app and easy to understand once you start! So I would recommend this for beginners! If anyone is seeing this have a good day/night !! <33"
5,GiioGriss,OMG THIS APP IS AMAZING BC I CAN ACTUALLY MAKE GOOD EDITS AND EDIT VIDEOS FOR MY CHANNEL! THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL APP! ALSO My YouTube Is GiioGriss
5,Broj890,I edit all of my videos with this app! It’s so great you can do everything you need but it’s super easy One thing I wish they would do that was add a YouTube shorts feature just like they did with TikTok
5,Emma/Alex/Noah,10/10 would recommend I love this app because I’m a beginner and I can make so many different things and express all my ideas
5,Rosebuv,Please put Amazon music in there I always wanted to put music my favorite in there 🥺😭
4,pleaseeee fix this if you can,Pls fix this is that i am a YouTube and I make videos but 8 ran out of room so I got rid of screenshots from the video and then randomly my video just was all black plz fix!
3,NYC 2nd grader,"Hi, at first I loved the app because it was free and I make roblox edits so it was awesome but it started taking up so much storage that I had to quit YouTube. Anyway you could get this fixed?"
4,capcut editior,Can y’all put it to were you can import the vid on YouTube
5,Marvel3019,"Overall, I really do love CapCut for editing videos, and the photo affects as well as pretty much all the other neat tools and tricks. But the one thing I do find a bit annoying is how you view all your projects. And what I mean to say, is I wish that there was a way you could collect all your projects into some sort of groups, or folders. As a way to organizes them I guess is what I’m saying. And I know it’s not something big, but I just feel like it would make searching for a specific project a lot easier.   But again, it’s just a small minor detail. Other then that, I love the app."
5,mymxlodyx,Capcut is the best Capcut is the best Capcut is the best Capcut is the best
5,lallelelalalele,I hope if y’all see this get the app it’s so good for beginners in editing I just started and is very pleased this app doesn’t take up all of your storage and is great recommend 1000/10
4,Dsmp_person2379,"The app is great and does a lot of the things I wanted to be able to do, but I have two suggestions - there needs to be an option to use music from apps like Spotify, Apple Music, and Pandora because I think that a lot of songs from music apps like those can be really good in edits and videos but we can’t use those. The other suggestion I have is that there needs to be lots of other stock videos for different things because some people (like myself) can’t get the videos or pictures they want because they simply don’t have access to it. If you took these things into consideration that would be great."
5,Bree-truth teller,I LOOOVVVEEEEE this editing app!!!!!! I can make so many good videos for FREE!!!!! I can use it for YouTube or maybe just to make an aesthetic video for my friends! You can do SO MUCH with this!!! So if you want to make good videos I really suggest getting this!!!!!!!!!! It’s not even hard to use. You just pick the video you want to edit then add whatever you want! My friend suggested this for my YouTube channel so I got it and LOVE it! Um so glad that there is a free editing app like this that I can use!
5,numblefox,CapCut is so cool in CapCut you put a lot of pictures in one second it all looks so cool after you put it all together.this app is the best that I have seen I hope you get it.
5,al al 😎😝,It is so easy I found out how to do it in a few minutes! Now I can make Gacha vids (i don’t have a YouTube channel) so easily!
1,Scarli492786,I’m not upset just I tried saving this video and sending it on YouTube. And it wouldn’t save. It would always say I have to clean up storage. I don’t have that much storage but it kept spamming the message. I’m sorry but please fix this app cause it won’t stop I’m just trying to be nice.   -Scarlett
4,ava sadler,Well cap cut is easy to use and is so easy to understand but I wish there was more effects and filters also adjusting is kinda hard and I’m a beginner so this is a mostly great app but could be more and only a few things are bad also i lOVE THis app just add how to use it on there to cause then you have to dive into YouTube tutorials or something  on google and it’s great and FREE recemend this to you if looking at this whole thing                                                                        -random right now 9 year old you’ll never hear from again
4,Kiisha Wiish,"I love CapCut! It’s easy to use and has nice effects, audio, and stickers- it’s also very smooth! But the things that’s wrong with it; Sometimes, my capcut says that I have insufficient storage. When I don’t. It forces me to either reinstall or delete two to three apps until it doesn’t say it’s full anymore. It also has lag problems on Motorola G (Android) phones. It lags a lot on there and sometimes cuts off the audio. I don’t know if the device just isn’t suitable for CapCut or it’s the developers intention, but those are all my problems. Great app!"
3,heybtobagdvfhe,I was excited to edit a video of mine for my YouTube (iiFlowerbeanii) after not posting for awhile the app keeps saying that something went wrong when downloading my video
5,mommy1636,"This app is very good for tiktok anime edits, but theres just one thing.   It Takes Up A Lot Of Space I know that having a ton of stuff on your phone would mean you have to delete a ton of photos, apps, and other things. Though it’s that this is one of the apps that had a lot of MB and GB. I had to redownload Capcut twice due to low disk space."
5,Ef2979,"I don’t like to make these things long and all I have to say is that CapCut is great app😆 it is so easy to work with the to figure out what to use! You can shorten the video, add effects, add filters, transitions and way more! If you want to figure out how to use it better and improve your editing skills go on YouTube and there is a lot of great videos to help you out! How to edit yourself, others, video game characters and etc. I would highly recommend this app and CapCut is the only editing app I use anymore 🙂 DOWNLOAD IT KNOW! IT IS AWESOME! Best app ever for editing! I really do hope there are more transition options in the future though"
5,Ebonflame,This app is very fun! It has filters songs and lots more. I can edit my YouTube videos know. I love the filters and the backgrounds. There is a bad thing about the song it should have some songs with words clean songs. I heard of it from my sister! I downloaded it and edit some videos. They where so good! I like doing voice over to it’s fun to talk over or as a different person in your videos. You can even post videos to TikTok. I would get this app if you want to edit pictures or videos!
3,Kittylover052011,"I’m so made right now, cause on CapCut, their is a button called a “key frame” and the key frame keys moving un-controllably! I was trying to post a video on my device, but the key frame wouldn’t let me edit that post, and that is what this app is made for. I wasreally raging   and upset when the happened, but other than that, I give this app CapCut, a 5/5 star rating. Please please pretty please with cherries on top check this out CapCut. Thanks for the time at reading this message. -Kittylover052011 (just put my Roblox username )"
1,Cassie's iPad 2006,WHY DOES IT TAKE UP 995.8 MB ON MY PHONE WHEN I ONLY HAVE ONE 20 SECOND EDIT. Other then that love the app.
2,bbvvvvbnhhhh,implement landscape editing
5,krista chankhour,Hii when I was looking for a editing app I saw this app  I was like it might be a good app but it was better then good.mal though I think three should be more things to edit with. Like more blurs  filters and more.
3,𝕂𝕒𝕚𝕓𝕒𝕓𝕪!!!!,So when i first got it it was perfect!!!it was always go edit how i wanted it.and it was really good effects but here are the things that need to be added and fixed. 1.please fix the promblems i was moving my vids by itself its weird 2.add more effects please.they are kinda boring there not bad but not good and they are all the SaMe!!!! 3.add more live vids.they are all the freakin same and BOOOoRINGGggGGG!!!!!! 4.add more sounds/songs they are all the same and kinda boring if you would atleast just add 40+ more and will be great:) 🥰✨  Sorry if its long
4,tvggbgbh,"It’s a amazing app, I recommend this for you if you just started.it updates with more effects and animations and tools.It’s very helpful for editing, however, it’s only the starting step for editing.It’s good for a beginner and learning to edit, but if your a pro and want to expand the limits this is not really the thing, it’s just the starter.But it’s a very very good starter.If you haven’t edited, download this app right now!!Some small bugs is when you a lot of graphs it starts to get REALLY REALLY glitchy.I really want you guys to fix that problem, using key frames help so much.The effects are very nice, and your updates keep on getting better.It’s very easy and simple to understand.It has everything labeled and set in a very memorable way.Apps like alight motion and etc. are very hard to understand and it takes a lot of time.for me, CapCut was Alonso a bit hard at first but I got a hand with it very fast.I recommend doing edits on CapCut for a decent amount of time and then move to alight motion, it’s very hard to understand but has more availability’s.CapCut, I would really like you to add the same recourses as alight motion and put it in a very simple way.You app overall is almost perfect and best app for beginners.Thank you so much, I’m really good at making edits on your platform and outside.its all because you this app."
1,Smileyshelby,YouTube tutorials show a menu at the bottom of the app that allows you to search for templates. This is missing and I’m not sure why. Maybe it’s a bug? I also do not have Tik Tok to search for templates.  Update (Dec. 2021): Developers have stated that templates (bottom menu) are only available in some regions. I live in the US and don’t have access. That was the greatest thing about the app but it’s useless now.
5,sw33tescape🖤,like this is the best app for starters of editing.the app is free to download no purchase no ads very good I like free stuff when. I started editing it was September or August 😀

5,Itz.Autumn,"。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。 Im Going To Try To Make This Review Easy To Read!:)  Ok so i think this is an AWESOME app its such a fun app, its so fun that i just try making random videos just so i can use the app!I 100% recommend this app its very entertaining to use and for people who dont wanna pay for “PREMIUM TO USE MUSIC” or “BUY PREMIUM SO YOU CAN HAVE A BETTER EXPERIENCE” this app is all free! And if people out there aren't trying to waste their money on some app then get CapCut! I absolutely L•O•V•E this app!  ••••••••  You can use this app for so many different things but heres the part for my recommendations!   RECOMMENDATIONS SECTION~~~  So I recommend that team CapCut to add more music options kinda like Spotify and I know thats a lot to ask for so maybe just like some more popular music! And maybe some old 90s music to!   ENDING•  Thank you so much for reading my Review i hope this helped you decide whether you want to get this app or not! Thank you guys and thank you CapCut for creating such an amazing app-"
5,LMPRETT,"So, i like to use the songs from sour (by Olivia rodrigo) so, here’s my hack. I use Spotify, and if u do two, try this hack:  Step 1: download a screen recording app Step 2: start recording, and play your selected song Step 3: then, stop the recording when the song/songs are over. Step 4: trim the clip to where you cut off the time at the end and the parts with no music. Step 5: then, save clip to your photos. Step 6: then, go into cap cuts, then press music, then go to songs, and press “your sounds”. And then, press extract sound, then you add the video, then ur done!  Any way, cap cut is a great app, and i would like it if u could name ur sound downloads. Ty!"

5,kitty cat lover1000,"I love this app so much! I’m a beginning editor, and I do it as a hobby, so I don’t have much experience and I don’t want to spend a bunch of money on expensive apps or expensive equipment, so this is amazing! The only thing I would change would be to add more songs and sounds to choose from. I know you can upload songs to your edits, but I don’t know how to do that and since I don’t have Spotify or Apple Music, I’m not able to do that. So I end up having to record my own voice, which is fine, but I’m no professional singer. All in all, this app is amazing and I totally recommend to beginner editors!"
5,BaconSquad,Basically lazy review bc im too lazy to write. So basically when I didn’t know capcut was a thing I used iMovie. iMovie wasn’t that great because it didn’t have much stuff + no updates and then when I found this app I was amazed by the reviews and I looked on YouTube to see if it was a good app and people said it was so I downloaded the app and THIS WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAN IMOVIE! Like it’s the best app ever you should download it and there’s so much effects and stuff and I am just amazed chef kiss try out the app it’s super good download it!
4,Random person😔✌️,ok cap-cut is overall pretty good but i hate it that there is not really good songs and i'm using a tablet that does not allow me to screen record for songs and i get so frustrated finding songs so i really want that you have more songs that are on youtube or we can find songs we like and not import them cuz it is frustrating to use no songs i keep trying to figure something out but their is nothing i can do so pls do that I'm begging have a nice day.
4,ærñv,CapCut taught me how to edit videos and now it makes my life a whole lot easier. If there was one thing I would change on the app is to enhance the audio choices. I love the audio choices there are now but I feel like there could be more. I also like how you can access your songs you have on a playlist or just a song in general. One thing you could do to change the sound choices is to add a search bar. An editor could search for a specific song instead of look at all of your choices. Plus if an editor has a time limit on the video like say they have 7 hours to complete the edit and send it back to the creator l just going to the search bar and finding a specific song it would save the editor some crucial time. I love CapCut because it lets your creative juices flow with no limit. Before I downloaded the app and I was reading some reviews. A couple of reviews said that the storage on the app wasn’t very good. I have not yet experienced that problem but I do throw out some of my older edits. Thank you CapCut for taking the time and reading this review and to others I hope you found it helpful!
5,Lola Lime :D,"I use this app almost every day just for fun. Random edits, cute scenery, tiktok, YouTube. Anything. Really easy to use. So many cute affects and filters. This app is great for beginners and pros. 😍❤️"
5,LiamT0216,This is the best editor ever because you can literally do text you can do effects it’s so crazy and so easy to use! Check out my channel here on YouTube: MarshMellysLT! That’s my channel to go see my videos on roblox and using this app. It’s very fun and easy  You should try it! Ty for reading. I hope it helped!
4,E...beth,For the next update that you guys have could you guys please add to where we could have accounts. Like it would save everything that we’ve done prior to y’all adding accounts but all we would have to do is make a username and password and it would save all of our projects. I just think I’d be a good idea in case someone broke their phone and they didn’t save any of their edits they could just login on a different device.
5,kittycon.,"I’m pleased with Capcut. I got it a couple of days ago and now I’m totally addicted. I taught myself; it’s a great beginner app. I highly recommend it for beginners and if you ever get stumped or want more “pizazz” just search things up on YouTube.  Also, pro tip, if you want an audio, screen record it then extract it into your video. Have fun creating!"
5,devinpitka,I use this app everyday for my YouTube videos and it’s absolutely amazing nothing costs money and no ads it’s the best app in my opinion 5000/5
5,FluffyTheDeer🦌,"Hello, I LOVE this app so much. It’s not like KindMaster, let me tell ya, but this app should be #1 on the App Store! I’m not joking! Download this app, after your first video, ❗️BOOM❗️ Amazed. I wanted to try out the app and see what it does, Bc why not?, and I made my first video and this is what happened: *Goes out of app*  *Sees KindMaster* *Gets rid of that Rinky-Dinky App*  Me: “All done!” That’s why you should try it!  now...for the suggestions!  1. Can you add TikTok songs? I have to go on YouTube, record the song, and put it in the video.   2. Can you have a tutorial on how to add green screens? I have found some on YouTube and I liked them but I don’t know how to get them on the app.  3. Can you add anime voices. I can’t speak like any anime character and I was just wondering. (If you don’t know what anime is, it is Japan shows.)  4. (This is not a suggestion) Anyways, Iove this app, like I said, It should be on the top of all apps! Thank you 🙏!"
5,🦄🦄🦄🦄😔😎,For me my editing apps I see most of the time I have to pay.But I love this app . It has great things to edit with and it’s a great start for people that don’t edit or edit much.
5,xzyam_hell0kitty,IT IS FREE AND VERY EASY TO FIND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR! This was my first editing app and still is and I have grown so much. I really hope it stays free!!!
3,lmnbw,"Ok so I had this app for awhile and it’s amazing!! I love it so much.One day I went to go to my phone to create a video on CapCut and it said I had to “insufficient storage”, and it said I had to delete some photos so I did as so but then it still said the same thing and then I got annoyed and deleted almost all my photos and videos and all videos on CapCut and I have only 10 photos and 1 video! And it STILL said the same thing I’m so mad because I made a really good video so I don’t wanna delete the app but it won’t let me enter the video bc I still have to much! This makes me very mad pls if you can do something about this-"
5,ava_ Crazy kid,Works best for YouTube videos
5,Parkerboo11,"Konnichiwa! Im very inpressed with this app. I am a professional editor on this now, and i only started a few months ago! It was eversense i was watching one of my favorite youtubers that they revealed they edit with CapCut so i decided to try it! And wow 😮! Its amazing i really love this, ive been wanting to create a chanel on youtube and this is the perfect editting app for it! Im just very inpressed!!!! Bye (If your wondering what konnichiwa is is hello in Japanese, im Japanese.)"
3,fix the fricken update 2021 z,So currently I’m trying to upload a YouTube video and I can’t bc my storage is full but what else do u want me to do I had to delete some of my photos and videos just to edit the video and now I have to delete apps and photos and stuff just to export it this should not be ok us youtubers and editors should be able to do our thing without deleting our creations I know y’all have to fix this right now and I mean right now as I’m writing this review I deleted like 54 things to try to get this code up for my viewers and I still can’t so y’all need to fix that problem do better
5,Catblanc lover,It’s a great app it sooooooo good it great for beginners I love it but there’s three things I wish you can fix’s I play Gacha life make videos so I make a lot of clips like 0.1 long but it glitches and if I put a lot in one video the video is super slow or weird so I have to put clips and then add them all together. But then it’s the overlay when you make a move I want it to be slow yes I know how to make it slow but it only goes one angel I want a character to walk up and down I just walks straight and then I have to give up on that video.and here’s something to add:maybe make a place where you can edit audio like merge audio add sound effects to go to then next song.But other than that its great 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
5,living chocolate,Okay.I always loved this app and still do and it helps a lot with my YouTube channel of gacha :))) I highly recommend this
5,tritty bear,"This game is just…..well, awesome! I’ve been using it since September and I have some things that it keeps doing.#1: overlays. Just a second ago I was making my edit and when I did the keyframe I was trying to get it to go down a little. But it just went all over the place! Of course I was a little mad, but it was doing good before that! Maybe you could help with that? #2:chroma key. We all know what chroma key does. It removes the color  from green screens! It’s often used for overlays. But when I used it, it looked, well… like an old piece  of paper  from 1832 that was cut out. I used ibisPaint x to edit it, and it looked like what I said. (No offense to the creators of ibisPaint x!) maybe you could make the overlays that were edited from ibisPaint x look a little more newer. Now to things I suggest. I really think your should make a little drawing button to those who can’t get ibisPaint or ibisPaint x. Next thing I think you should add is pet stickers and hand stickers, and a custom sticker button a recording button instead of just uploading videos so we can save storage. That’s all I suggest. Overall, this app is AMAZING.  Without this i would be a TERRIBLE editor. 5 star always!"
4,Creepy_pasta!,"Hi,I’ve have been working on a new intro for YT but I left the then my storage was full when I came back and I worked SO hard on that intro it made me sad.But the game is great and all, its  just is SO annoying.So I think some updating would be very help-ful.i don’t know any other editing apps.So plz update.But over all it’s pretty great."
5,CarpetJizzer,"I have been looking for a app that has the capability to be just as good as the ones on PC for my Youtube Channel, and i haven't found one better than CapCut, easy to use, same abilities as filmora and more complex editing software unlike most other editing software like IMovie, just make sure to have enough storage, other than that i strongly recommend this app."
5,olshsuatafudisgso,So everything is good but the text can you make one where it is a flame and can change the colors and stuff like as a example search up on YouTube blue face edit #shorts pls and thank you!!….!!
4,me its me JJ Jane,It’s a good app I mean it could use work. First it always says my storage is full so I delete some apps it still says it’s full so I deleted my photos FULL.😐this really annoyed me! So I reset me iPhone And it doesn’t work. I wasted me time.it’s also not as good as other apps like video star king master It’s nice that you can delete the watermark tho. Overall it’s alright but not necessarily good.
5,ruby.yeeeee,"This app is amazing, it has all the features you need and is completely free. It is really good for animation and things and i would 1000000% recommend!"
5,Drab Dragon of Gigantic Desert,"If your looking for a video editor that’s totally free, this is the one! Just delete the watermark at the end (100% FREE) unless you feel like keeping it. Other than that, this app is easy to use and has helped me make some TikTok videos, you can use this on anything other than TikTok if you’d like as I may use this for YouTube editing also. (Haven’t yet but I bet the edits will also come out good just like my TikTok edits.)  10/10 Recommended to friends&family!!!"

5,Emmi❤️‍🔥,"CapCut is a very nice app! It’s easy, free, and fun! I recommend this app for ppl who want to make edits, or like me a YouTube channel! They also don’t have a watermark! I love CapCut!"
3,ThatGuyMason,"I am using an iPhone 8, and the templates tab isn’t showing up. I’ve been trying to get it using YouTube tutorials for a week now and it still hasn’t come up. Other that that, perfect app!"
5,dj synzk,So I was just looking for a editing app andI found this it has YouTube stuff and effects And even more more. I give it 5 out of 5 star’s
4,cjskxock,I honestly feel like if CapCut had graphs that edits could be a lot smoother. It wouldn’t be stiff and laggy.also add tiles and shakes
4,this is 10:10,It’s a really good editing app but I’m trying to redownload the app and its not working so now I can’t edit. But the app is really good I love all of the animations.But can you guys make it so that we can add more overlays it will make it more easy to do animation  I will really like this editing app way more than I do right now.Ahywasy this app is really really really really really really really really really really really really really really good so keep making this editing app really good bye!
4,Momo39577283,Okay so i have been using this app for a while and the graphs update just came out not so long ago. (I have an iphone) and every time i click on the graphs button it says “Use graphs to customize translations key frames.” From there it doesn’t let me use the graphs and it just says that. I don’t know if this is because i’m not doing something right or that if i need to do something before doing the graphs. This might just be my capcut being weird. I’ve watched some youtube videos and i have seen anyone go though what im going though so im just confused on what im meant to do. Besides that this app is pretty good for an editing app. 4/5
5,🌸🧡,Ok so I was watching YouTube  and they were using CapCut and I was like I want to do that and that’s when I found it  it’s so cool!!!

5,Hudson Mancebo,I just want to say CapCut is the best or at least one of the best FREE editing apps out there I have no idea how to do editing but I saw my friends using this so I decided to give it a try it is so easy for beginners and I love how easy it is to make videos for TikTok and YouTube overall I love CapCut I may just be stupid but I’d really like if there was a way to you take sound out of the video completelyEspecially for videos where you’re moving the camera around a lot and it makes weird noises or picks up noise from your breathing that mayBe a feature and I just don’t know it but either way CapCutIs amazingAnd I will continue to use it for a long time
4,Brooklynnplayz3,PLZZ add somewhere where we can look at other people’s work and we are aloud to make a channel there! We can be cloggers on that app! Also add uhm get to edit the background and channel part! My fam will love if that could happen! (Just some advice so you can have more people using it and YouTube! You can earn money with this! Think of it!)-hey I’m just helping 🤩
4,bshdjhshsosjs,I love this I use it all the time to edit YouTube vids but it needs to be less complicated
4,man too,Capcut is a great editing app it just needs better fonts Android has a lot of fonts iOS does not have if capcut were to give some good fonts to iOS capcut would be a spectacular editing app if they just gave iOS better fonts and upgrade some effects. And they should also make it so you can have as many overlay tracks as possible. And capcut should also add some new animations and transitions. And that’s all I think capcut needs to do in Oder to be spectacular
5,Hannahtube,I love this app so much! I edit all of my YouTube videos with it!💖💖💖💖 I have only had one little bug but it has only happened twice!!! This app is amazing! Hands down best app for editing! Everything is absolutely free!!!! My dad bought this 300$ editing app and I told him to try CapCut (which is totally free!) and he tried it and now he loves it so much he says ikr is way better than his 300$ app!!!!

3,#bff forever,So first the title is the reason I am making this I had to DELETE CapCut because of the mb! It’s too high pleas PLEASE lower the mb!
5,GargFamily,"Hi, this app is great, it’s amazing for Gacha video editing which I, personally do A WHOLE LOT. Where I found this app was, a while back my sister made aesthetic videos with the app CapCut. I used to use iMovie on laptop but got too hard. I’m very greatful to be able to have this app. My sister recommended me it because I was a Gacha video editing and a lot of ppl use this.But can you add more text options? There is only like a few, while other editing softwares have many to choose, While CapCut only has a few. Plus, have not updated them AT ALL. I am hoping this will come in future updates. Also, one quick question. Do you have any socials? Where people can share ideas for future updates? I would love that. But I love the fact there are soooo many aesthetic audios, and pop, rock, jazz, soft, Japanese and you name it! Sadly I have to give… FIVE STARS! Thank you for all the amazing features."
4,hdwj ok cd,"I’m a beginner at gachatube and editing, and I think this app is amazing for beginners! There is only one problem… I keep seeing something about a graphs update on Youtube, but I can’t find it on my app and I haven’t got the option to update Capcut."
5,deyymin,"I have been using CapCut for a year and it never lets me down, their is so many features such as filters, fonts, and editing tools. Before every app was hard to edit videos until I found CapCut. They make it so simple and easy and deserve 100/10 review."
5,BNUUY 🐰,"i think this app is super handy, but where’s version 4.6.0? everyone’s been talking about it, but i can’t find it on android OR iOS. what is the deal- EDIT: nvm, 4.6.0 is here now :]"
5,Corinne/AestheticSunflowers,"I have an edits YouTube channel, and by far, this is the best editing app I have found!"
5,Random Landen YT,"First of all, I upload all of my YouTube videos with this, it’s free to use, and it’s overall amazing.  The question I have is how do you make thumbnails for YouTube? I know how to edit them, but I don’t know how to apply them to the video. Thanks!"
3,Dr. Drew15,I was really liking this app and started using it for all my edits but now I noticed it updated and everything looks weird I can’t make edits the same way I used to so I’m disappointed. I also noticed some transitions are gone and the transitions aren’t in the place they use to be everything is flipped around it’s making it hard to do anything on this app. Please fix this cause I need to make an edit for my YouTube channel
5,Saeed H.F,"I found this app about 1month ago and it’s realllllly the best MOVIE EDITOR EVER!! without any doubt! Everything is great on IOS, BUT , I have problem opening .MOV videos on ANDROID!  I just send my .MOV files from IPHONE to SAMSUNG TABLET for having bigger LCD size there, but unfortunately CAPCUT ANDROID VERSION don’t open these files!!  Anybody knows any solution for it??  Best regards."
5,itsano2121,Don’t get me wrong. I love this app. But what if I had to delete this or get a new phone? Will all of my work be safe or will it be gone?

1,billie elesh,Down j few uh wid buc d. Nicer. N hucdnI HATE IT UHG
4,RyleeLovesCats 🐈,"This app is awesome and I Definite recommend getting this app you can do just about anything and it’s free as a bee! I’ve made countless videos on this app snd I love it so much it lets you add how long hints show up for text, music, animation for things like text, it has text to speech, voice overs and much more! I love there music but I wish I could import my own..well you can do that but you have to have iTunes, witch I don’t have. I have Spotify and you can’t import it from there that’s the one thing that I would like this app to add. But otherwise really this this is too good to be true…but guess what it is true everything you could think of for and editing app is all in this one for free! Now go on, download it!"
5,abcdefghijklmopqrsynz,CapCut is wonderful but the thing is capcut is not good enough they need to add atleast a phew things every week maybe or something because my fans need some more action but CapCut is plain I want more motion in CapCut over all it’s great and I think it should be for 10+ because my cuz wants to do it and I think 10 year olds can do it and it’s ok if not I was just wondering and CapCut thanks so much I would not have grew so much on YouTube without you ty peace out
1,•bxrey_angej.,Ok so CapCut is a great app I’ve been CapCut for years but today I tried making an edit for YouTube and all m edits were gone I tried to close the app and reopen it but it didn’t work. Pls fix this right away.
1,brianabrols,"CapCut is great for beginners. But, i have a problem. The reason why i give it a half star because of storage. When i got the app I loved it then it told me I needed an album? I was so confused. I search it up on YouTube and it showed nothing..? I started to freak out because I only like that editing app. I had like 300 photos and videos all together! now I’m not going on it because of the storage an album problem. thanks for reading!"

5,bob15835,I just got this app about a month ago but I am obsessed that I can’t stop making edits it is the best thing if you were trying to create a YouTube channel or TickTock channel for a Roblox edits! I think this app is amazing and you should definitely try it it is the best thing that has come! However I am still learning how to use it and I do have questions I enjoy this very much!
4,"Your obidiant servant, A.Burr","I have a ton of problems importing videos. And with the latest update, it won’t let me save videos without telling me to go into my settings and allow access to my photos (which isn’t even an option, and I could save before)  I personally don’t use capcut for editing often, but please add graphs. It would be amazing. Also more transitions would be nice.  I wish capcut would sustain longer video imports and file sizes.  I use capcut for editing my YouTube videos, but it’s hard when it starts lagging when I try to edit a video longer than 5 minutes.   But, these are just my complaints. Capcut is an amazing editing app, it has a ton of options for transitions, filters & effects with no charge."
4,Star is da best,I absolutely love this app!! It’s been working fine but all a sudden all me edits disappeared and my video that I was working on for my YouTube channel was gone and I couldn’t fix it!! I hope you can fix this I really want my content back
2,ItsFunnehfan4ever,"Hello! So, I usually use CapCut for my YouTube videos. But most of the time CapCut just doesn’t work and says I have to clear up some photos and apps. This makes me really annoyed because I’ve dealt with this problem for 2 weeks now. Maybe you could fix it? Idk but I just hope it works right again."
4,i P h o n e U s e r,"I like it a lot, but it needs new things like selective zoom, subtitles in Spanish, ability to import fonts, cloud saving (not on iCloud) and things like that.   This has nothing to do but, I want to spread the Gospel, so If you follow God, or want to, might like my page, this is not for my benefit, it’s for you and God’s Kingdom. God bless you a lot. @horizons_"
3,Aizennnnnnn..,"CAPCUT,, BABES.. U KEEP ADDING SO MUCH STUFF BUT GRAPHS PLS ADD GRAPHSSSXENXHRNX"
5,Kq12/,"I have used free apps for a while to edit youtube videos but all the free app editors had watermarks and didn’t have good filters and all the extra animation that capcut has. This is the best free editor app i’ve come across in all my years in video editing. It is even better than some payed editors. I highly recommend and promise you wont be disappointed in getting this app. However a very annoying thing ive noticed is that when I have a few lines of text in my edit and have animations on all of them, only some of the animations will save and the rest will stop doing the animations. Please fix this, it will my editing a lot easier. Thanks."
5,Thunder_Lane,I think it’s a great app and it really helps me make videos for my YouTube channel
3,Chelseakaralen,I have a editing apps and there hard to edit. This is the best editing app ever so tysm whoever made this app. I can now make better YouTube videos cause of this app. I love this app so much. This is so fun to use I had no videos to edit and I wanted to edit still. Tysm whoever made this app bc this app is the best editing app ever!
4,s u p e r!,"hi, I have been using this app for almost a year now and I would say this app is really nice! it could use some improvements.but otherwise it’s  really nice! I just wish some things like the diamond  tool, was a little more smooth,but that’s my opinion. I suggest getting this app and practice."
5,emmamoonxx,I love the app it is free which makes it easy to create YouTube videos and edits.
5,popcornhat,BEST APP DOWNLOAD NOW I USE IT FOR YOUTUBE ITS AMAZING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,✨🤍✨RyLeE🤍✨,I love this app I ate all my videos I put on YouTube and I love it teachers in my opinion is it free and since I personally do not want to spend any money on an app game I really like cat cat since it’s free but I just have some things I can’t do what you can do another abs it cost money you be fine but that’s just me in my own opinion but I really like it and I recommend downloading it if you are adding or if you’re starting off your YouTube channel or for example Tik Tok account or maybe you’re adding some thing to post on Instagram such as a Instagram video or some thing I recommend loading this up and if you’re making the cameras for videos directly down downloading picsart as well
3,cancelling asap,"I like it but I hate it when it says “no photos here, make some now!” WHEN CLEARLY I HAVE TONS OF PHOTOS! This happens every time I touch the music part, but still useful for my YouTube videos!"
4,dhfyjshkc ghfurmrhfh tryrtrj,I love the app and all but when I press on the text to spearhead button it always says no Internet connection and my internet is perfectly fine please fix the glitch cuz I may make this review a 1 pls fix it @capcut
4,Im.not.pog.hehe,"Hey! When i first ever got CapCut it was a really easy app even for me and my little cousin (10) i was a Gacha kid and wanted to make Gacha life Tiktoks so someone commented on my videos saying that i should use capcut it easier and quicker so i did. Soon after, i became a dream smp fan, i edited velocities, photo montages, videos of my drawings, and etc. then it comes to now 09/16/21 i have no clue what i am I’m just making ghost face edits and edits of random people. It’s really easy to use as i said in the beginning, but fr i mean it I’ll be using this app until it dies. bUuuut the real reason why i only gave it 4 stars is because, it’s been glitching recently so I’m having a hard time rn."
4,@yourfavweirdo on tt,Capcut is a very easy editing app and helped me learn lots. It is also free which is great but there are a few suggestions I have.   One thing that I totally recommend is for the text to be updated. By this I mean that it would be good if we could edit word by word when we type a phrase. This would also save a lot of time.  Also I noticed that on android devices that you can now add your own fonts from websites like “dafont.com” and was wondering if that update will be coming to IOS. Also a few new fonts would be great! I totally recommend the font “Lemon Milk”.  Another thing I think would be good is if you guys made a velocity feature to slow down clips or made your speed feature a bit smoother.   This would all really help make my edits a whole lot better.

5,CheetoGirlRulz,"So good, bottom of my heart people could make movies from this. Total savior been using since Jan 9 2021 and it’s completely changed everything."
5,sogslover_bella34,"I have used this app to make tiktok edits and to edit youtube videos! And I love it!! I have used it for a pretty long time now and to be honest i think i like it more than iMovie. IMovie is great but this app is also great! I will say iMovie have some features that capcut doesn’t but it’s still great! Scrolling through the videos is really fast unlike iMovie. When you scroll through the video on imovie it is kinda slow especially for a long video. But capcut can scroll through the videos fast! Also you can cut the videos easier in capcut than iMovie. Other good things about capcut is that they feature more animations, text templates, and music! Although i used iMovie for many years, i think i like capcut even more. :)"
5,spacegurlllll9182,It's great needs some work for example maybe a tutorial since newbies are very likley to get lost. and if going on youtube they are comparing this app to others which could cause this app to loose people and eventually dissapearing. but make it skipable.
5,heyyItzAva,"First of all this is an amazing app I do gacha life with it . I do have a suggestion for this app there should be an eraser that you can erase some of the photo and fill it in with something else. Anyways I prefer this app then any other one.second suggestion is that can we just search up music? It would be so helpful because I don’t like the other apps.also  One thing I hate is that when you add the photos the slides take a long time I know how to cut them out but can you please make them a bit shorter I would be more then grateful. One thing I love is it is so easier then any other editing app ,I use to use FMP but it got too hard so I looked for some other I was looking and looking till I found cap cut so easy to use. Anyways thank you so much for reading this bye!"
5,Ivi paint,"I love this app I have so many videos with this app. Its so cool you can do so many things, Putting music is easy too you need to make a video and click to sounds in there are three options click exterior but first go to YouTube and do a screen video from the song you want then go to CapCut and do your video click sounds click exterior and click in the screen video you made and done music and everything ☺️☺️"
5,winters_artwork,"Capcut is an awesome app, i use it to edit music videos for my zepeto group nextlevel.zpt !!! but i have a few requests, it would be HEAVENLY if an option to skew photos & overlays were possible, because i have to switch to another app to do that. it would also be awesome to add color to the video/overlay, to make it blend better with the background. Also, being able to manually erase part of the video/overlay instead of only cropping!!!! those are some of my wishes, i really want to continue to use capcut!! <3"

I love all of the properties to choose from, (Text properties, effects, etc.) I would 100% Recommend this app and was recommended it myself. it’s amazingly free as well! Thank you for making a great free video editor!"
4,MRPOOPYPOOP225,Well I want a cover just for fun and then when i put it to YouTube it shows the cover in the video while watching but everything else pretty nice
4,$till_Lost,"I have been using CapCut for a while and it is a great app. It’s free, no ads, no watermark, and tons of effects and filters to use! I use it to edit YouTube videos and make edits and I have only came across one problem. Sometimes when I am not touching the screen for a short period of time, the main screen (edit, audio, text, stickers, overlay, effects, filters, format, canvas, adjust) that screen will turn grey and there will be no icons or anything they all disappear and I can’t click anything there. Everything else works during that time but I cannot add anything so I have to close the project and re-open it. I even updated the app but it still happens. Re-opening the project is not a big deal but when I’m trying to edit 30 minute long videos fir my YouTube, it gets annoying. Please fix if you can or tell me how to fix this. Other then that, this app is great!"

5,uhygubefsbefufshe,"I love this app, it’s how I make my YouTube channel videos! The key frames make me able to do some what of custom transitions!"
5,cool🥶,"Usually I installed it, and needed help for my YouTube video. And not all the other apps work for me! So I found this app and I was able to turn it into a dream of making every single thing right. And usually we can change it into any type of language of the basic type of Korean, Japanese, Asian, Tagalog, or any type of language that some of you speak.. I used this app for 10 months and The whole entire app was pretty cool and having some pretty cool updates on it! And my brother has been using it for 50 months more than I did, Cuz’ If you guys download this pretty cool app! You will actually love this developer what he or she just made Cuz’ it’s more better more than PicsArt cuz’ it showed up not from CapCut only at the end also my friend have been using CapCut for 70 weeks So yeah that is why we vote for CapCut more than PicsArt! Also If the Developer it’s looking at my comment! Thank you for making the whole intire set of steps for me! Or for anyone else.."

1,101vids,"I loved the app at first and it was perfect until you try to export your finished project, bunch of mf waste of time. Even went to their YouTube page for help and it still failed. I’d avoid this app and wasting your precious time"
4,khxlyd,Capcut is a very nice app AnD it’s for free?!? I do YouTube videos and tiktok edits it’s a very good and easy app to edit on just I wish the effects and animations would have more maybe take some notes from video star! And alimotion sorry if I spelled one wronge.   Video star and alitmotion are very good apps but are too hard for me to find out to use and I need to buy some things from the app so if you stay free capcut TRUST me you will soon be a five star app if you find out how to add the animation and effects from both of theses apps also add more animations!!!
5,kennedie <3 bae,"So, I’m in love with capcut. It’s literally the only app I use to edit videos on tiktok. Follow my tiktok @kennedieee0 . I rlly wanna use video star but it’s so confusing and I rlly don’t wanna waste my money on somethin I don’t know how to do.

4,Cute unicorngirl4692,"This app does give me some stress while editing my YouTube videos also my channel name is “《•「XxKaulaxX」•》” it stresses me because when I want to edit again, it does something wrong to it and I think I wanted to be fixed. Also, when I do text to speech and play it while I’m editing, I can’t hear the voice that well it just glitches. Those need to be fixed. Anyways it’s still very cool! I like it! Good editing app but still has bugs.."

ITS JUST CRAZY I love this editing app so much I edit all my videos on YouTube with CapCut and it’s AMAZING for intros! I JUST DONT GET IT!!! I love CapCut 5/5 DEFINITELY"
5,galacticfoxy6676,"I love CapCut! It’s really helpful for my edits. I do Roblox edits and sometimes I use CapCut to edit my YouTube videos. But one thing that kinda gets in my nerves is, everyone j want to add a photo it says I don’t have any. So I go back and check my camera roll and I have photos. So i don’t know if it’s just a glitch… but that’s really it! I totally recommend this app to edit your videos."

3,Jazzy Pretty LOLO,This app is a perfect for Editinf no watermarks no Paying no nothing but It takes a HELLA amount of space not 112 MB IM TALKING GB IT SHOULDENT TAKE THAT MUCH SPACE!
5,lilsumcrab,this app helped me with YouTube videos with editing and Tiktoks/Instagram THIS APP GOT MY VIDEO 13k likes and 7K followers YOU GUYS NEED TO GET THIS APP NOW
2,the best fr0g,"As you can see, as a YouTube you need to upload so I use this,  Though every once in a while it says that I have no storage left, so I have to delete an app that I love to make more content unless I re- get the app, which is what I’m doing, this doesn’t make sence"
5,I LOVE GNIS HAPDOUSHEJDJDJHXBD,Poop
1,Exo_And_Yoyo4Life,"I wanted to get this app for the templates that other people have made in the past but when I opened it, it literally did not have the option for templates, nor the other options in the bottom that normally showed up in YouTube reviews. Am I tripping or what??"
5,love the app beause,I love this app Beause you get to do so kuch thing on it and you can do cool thing too you can make intros edits videos for your YouTube channel  and you can post your videos on tiktok any platform I love cap cut you should download it will change your channel  YouTube channel queen sis plays gaming and queen sis plays
5,can you plaese please add,10/10 should use I use it for all my YouTube vids and I get hundreds of likes so if ur an upcoming YouTube get CapCut! Trust me it works miracles!
4,gacha life lady,"This app is amazing and useful especially when I want to make YouTube videos! And I especially love that there is no watermark or premium!! That makes everything better and makes it easier to make my videos look professional! I do have one small problem though:when I import sound and then go to photos, It says: No photos here! Take some pictures to add to your video! Or something like that. This is very frustrating when I want to make videos. But other than that this is an amazing app and I think everyone should have this app if they enjoy making videos but hate the popups that say: Get premium now! Or Go premium! And people who don’t like the watermark at the top!!"
5,Fastmat23,I love the app! And I use it a lot for editing my YouTube videos! But there is one thing I really hate:( it takes up so much storage on my IPad and I can’t really have any other apps on this IPad because it takes up so much storage! It takes up 2.87 GB on my IPad so if there is anything you can do please fix the amount of storage it takes up...
5,Dlyetnal Ghebere,WaAah wanna break from the adds

5,synflower cookie🌈✌🏾💖,I’m starting a YouTube channel and every time I do a voiceover it sounds like a beeping sound please fix it now!!!!!😤😤 it upsets me so much every time I try to do a voiceover it’s a big beeping sound
5,🥶IcyDicey,"I feel like this app is really cool and it makes it really easy to edit videos, especially gaming. All the cool effects makes everything look good, the audio control is amazing, etc. But one thing I wish they would change is how when you download the video from CapCut to your camera roll and the screen pops up that tells you where you can share it, (Like Instagram) I feel like it would be good to put YouTube there as well. Other apps have done this too and I hope the developer will add this feature!"
3,K.Jsmith,More animations
4,4digital,hey i just want to say please remove the watermark that’s like at the end great app tho i just needed to learn how to use it from youtube so great app!
4,Delj4,"This app is great for my edits that I love to make but one thing that is super annoying about this app is that if I save a YouTube video into my camera role to edit, it doesn’t save In CapCut, it shows the video that I took before it, but when I click recents at the top, it shows that it has the video but just won’t let me put it into my video, it really annoys me and I hope you can change this and if not I’m probably gonna move to a different editors app because I’ve tried everything and this app this doesn’t work. Another problem I had with this app is that it said that I couldn’t use the filters because I didn’t have wifi but I was full bars, and my phone isn’t old so it wouldn’t be something that’s a glitch in my phone. Please fix so I don’t have to change my source 😁✌🏽☺️"
4,MCGG1981,I tried CapCut and I liked it I made lots of roblox and tik tok edits.I also made Gathca Club edits.But whenever I try to edit my video it won’t let me because I need to update it but I can’t update it!!!!!!! PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!
5,1234 ttyt,"I 100% recommended this app, personally this is my favorite video editor! It’s free, easy to use, cool to make edits and edit regular YouTube videos! However I have 2 suggestions. I think it’s really cool that it has a camera roll sticker feature, however you can only do pictures. I think it will be really cool if you can also make it so you can do videos, my last video editor had that feature but it was like $10, something I was not willing to pay. I would like it so I can do reactions, and more. I also wish you can search music. Other than that, this is an amazing editor and I definitely recommend."

5,🌼mya🌼,"I love capcut I love the shakes transition and other stuff . So my first suggestion is we should have a thing we’re you can make an velocity edit I know video star already have this but you have to pay but if y’all make velocity thing then we can get it for free .  And I know we got something like a thing that makes your video go fast and slow but I feel like the thing like video star would be better.next more fonts I don’t really have nothing to say about fonts but yea we just need more fonts. Next more animations like a hard zigzag shake or something Yall can think of . Next y’all should make something like when we can add more than one animation than making another project and add the animation then go back to the original project an add the 2nd project and then add another animation. Next you guys should add more stock videos like green screens of cards,Pokémon ball,laptops,and more you guys can think of. Next more filters . And that’s all hope you like my suggestions"
5,mykikacat,It’s a very good app and I love that everything is free but one small thing I noticed is that maybe by the export part you could add an export to YouTube so it much easier than having to open the app ever time I wanna publish a video but overall an AMAZING app and definitely recommend.
4,GachaDaniLover,"So I love this app I use it for everything but there’s things I wish there were in the app. So one thing is more animations, I love the animations but I’m sure I used every one and I think it could use more animations. Next is quality. When I export it with high and smooth frames and when I upload it to YouTube the quality looks rly bad. Idk if it’s YouTube or the app. Next is more effects. Now ik that there r a lot of effects but I think the app could add a effect like a black explode with the picture fading out like it comes out from the picture. That wold be cool with a edit in my opinion. I hope this isn’t to much but I do love the app it’s rly great⭐️"
5,mady 123,"Hi! I love this app it’s my main editor for my YouTube channel! I want to grow my channel and let’s just say.. it has once I switched from iMovie to KineMaster To THIS! 5 Stars! Here’s a suggestion: New Effects! Bulge and pinch!  Where you can move the effects around anywhere, I mean like the wand section effects thing that would be amazing 🤩 love your app 5 stars!  Thanks for reading! Ps: if anyone’s curious about my yt it’s called Ech Noirs"
5,luna wolfey angel,"This app helps me with my YouTube channel and has its own unique features that inspires me ✨ one thing is sometimes the bar on the bottom glitches or deletes clips I added that I worked hard on, other then that it’s still a great app for beginners on YouTube or inspired developers."

4,d.n.c.dnc123,"I think this app is very good for mostly simple edits and for beginners like myself! I think with just a little help from YouTube videos and the internet, you can make some pretty cool edits that you can save on your device! :)"
3,gg g gv g vu. ug ugu bu,"So my problem is you can't use half of the stuff that's in the app since it says you have no internet connection when you do, I searched it on YouTube and it said you had to live in South Korea or get a vpn to make it look like you are in South Korea, pls fix this half of your features are going to waste"

5,XxAminWormxX,It’s really great download it if your a YouTube or TikTok Instagram any social media or for family and friends it’s easy too
5,tyforthisaoo,Im not going to lie its the best app if you’re a beginner okay but i would love if they’re more effects and more like video star kit so difficult though.The best app though
4,gh0ulgutzz,i love this 10/10 its just i wish you could add a thing where you can add transitions to your favourites because it kinda gets annoying when you have to scroll and scroll to find it when you could just click a button and all your favourite or recently used transitions are there! other than that i give the app a 10/10 and if there are any people reading this then go ahead and download it theres no ads and it really easy to use and you can find a bunch of tutorial on YouTube and TikTok!
4,coco 34658,It Says you’re storage is full! YOU NEED TO DELETE YOUR WORK.DON’T GET THIS APP! I would give this a 0/5. It’s just useless. I have 1 video and it says YOU’RE STORAGE IS FULL! WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH THIS APP! Don’t get it’s very bad🙄✋ try it out. It’s your opinion.I’m trying not to be so dramatic but this app needs to get fixed.I’m sorry but I had to say this bc this app is making me mad

4,😐🥱🙄,I saw some write about this but this really needs to stop with the “no storage” my friend is trying to get a YouTube but I can’t edit her videos cause this stupid app won’t let me get the video and edit really needs an update I really hate the “no storage”😐
5,Khderbjjjiio,"i don’t know what i was expecting, but certainly not what this app has to offer. i have been filming youtube videos for over 5 years now, & until finding this app, i had yet to find an editing app with trendy, aesthetic - all around everything i needed in an editing app. imovie & videofxlive is nothing compared to this app. not only is this app extremely beginner friendly, it also has a VARIETY of effects, fonts, filters, animations, copy-write free music, & almost anything you can imagine in an editing app. the music is trendy & far from cliche. the fonts are VERY TRENDY & come in many many different expressions & styles. the filters are categorized by nature, food, vhs, lifestyle, soooo many choices! not to mention: EVERYTHING ON THE APP IS FREE! as well as 0 watermarks! thank you for creating such AN AMAZING, HANDY, CREATIVE iphone editor! the only con that i have heard from this app is that it doesn’t support videos over 15 minutes, & that’s not a problem, videos over 15 minutes are very rare to make on an iphone anyways due to storage limitations. overall i SO PLEASED with this app. 5/5 stars for me."
3,not that bad guys xD,For the good part it’s great you can do lots of animating and the sickest are great the app is amazing when I came across this app 2 Months ago this app was perfect but today I got a new iPad and also and android because some thing worn working right. The only problem I keep having is when I set my photos to 1 second or lower it will glitch to the next photo without showing it on the view screen. Second it will tell me to update the app so I would do it but it would already be updated. That’s all I need those fixed please thanks for your time 👍
4,hussein kadhum,Whenever I use an overlay and I replay the edit to see if it was used correctly and it lags only when I use transitions and overlays would you please fix this? Its annoying when it lags out of nowhere skipping some of the next clip/image.Thank you.
5,killakingad,"I really love this app, I’ve been using this for months now. I’d just like to give a few comments and suggestions. So, trying to make a velocity edit on here is pretty hard and it usually doesn’t fit to peoples standers. I’m trying to make a transparent watermark but all I can do is lower the capacity or try doing this hack I found on YouTube which failed by the way😂. I hope that we can get more animations for the text (loop). I find it stressful that I can’t split the effects in anyway, and it’s be cool if the effects had an option to fade in and fade out. Also I also find it stressful and time consuming when on a clip I can’t put both fade in and fade out so what I have to do is split the clip and on one part of the clip I put fade in and the other fade out. I also hate that the app demands that I free up space and because of that I had to delete all my games because the app is way to good😣. It’d also be great if we were able to make 8d audio on this app. You should also add more effects for the audio. That’s all that I could think of for now👋"
5,Eric6171,This app is AWESOME and inspired me to make a YouTube channel
2,Ororkfkrldckgk,"I enjoyed CapCut in the beginning. It was easy to learn and get used to. Yesterday I was editing a video to upload to my YouTube. When I was done I clicked saved and it said  “not enough memory”. I deleted some photos in my camera roll, some drafts in CapCut, and cleared my cache in CapCut settings. Once I tried again it still said “not enough memory”. I was really disappointed because I spent over 45 minutes editing that. I looked up on YouTube “what to do when CapCut won’t save your videos” and there were no tutorials, it was just people complaining about the same problem. I looked in the comments and people were also saying they had the same problem. This wasn’t happening until now. I’ve had CapCut for a while now and it hasn’t done this before. At the moment I am not pleased and very disappointed. I hope CapCut can fix this soon."
5,Avi the queen,CapCut is one of the best apps you can use for editing.It helps with a lot of things you can do with anything but in a shortcut way things you can do by editing it’s just so easy on the app and sorry guys I’m not really used to reviewing but this app is so amazing and you guys need to get it I love it so much is good for videos and pictures is this get in there in the bag that’s free it makes it even better I love you it helps with a lot of things you can do with anything but in a shortcut way things you can do by editing it’s just so easy on the app and sorry guys I’m not really used to reviewing but this app is so amazing and you guys need to get it I love it so much is good for videos and pictures the fact  that’s free it makes it even better I love you CapCut .
5,hi my name is cali,I love this game it is the best it has so many things so you can edit.it’s amazing! I edited so many things and they now look fab! I live the app it might need some practice to get really good but it’s awesome!
4,tangle the pirate,So basically I’ve been using this ever since I started making a YouTube channel but I hate that I have to delete videos I love and proud of it always says I have full storage even tho I have like three videos
1,lalalalalalcarebaer,I saw this game on YouTube and I pressed download but it won’t let me download it
4,laffy taffy 1223668#759,Sometimes CapCut on my tablet it says there’s like no storage left and I can’t save the video that I did but yet I have nothing that’s like taking up a lot of storage and I really hate that so I think you guys should update it because it’s really getting me annoyed How I have to l screen record the video that I’m doing so can you guys change that because I’m gonna start a YouTube channel but if that’s keeps on popping up I’m not gonna be able to post any of my videos but overall this app is really good
4,Roree S.,"I went through 3 absolutely terrible editing apps before this and they all made me pay! This app is completely free and has great transitions/animations. I definitely recommend if you enjoy making videos! I have a YouTube channel (it’s called, I ✨Simp✨ For Saya) And post regularly on there, this app helps a lot! Have a great day/night!💕"
3,Cassie Vlogs,"I love this app it’s free and no watermark, but when I try to post a YouTube video and I’ll do the cover a K a thumbnail it doesn’t show up so that stinks, other than that it’s an OK app I recommend it for you editors but honestly I like it a lot better than kindmaster but still I don’t know why the cover a.k.a. thumbnail it’s not working so other than that it’s an OK app"
4,lesinoa,So this app is great it’s very easy for beginner editors and I’ve been using it for a while but there are a few suggestions I think  should be made. First I cannot change my frames sometimes when I post my edit it’s always a cube shape and I cannot fix it there is no option for me to have another picture frame rate. Next is the quality so I made a edit and it was a HD quality video and I selected  the frame rate 50 and the quality 2k and when I exported it and posted it on YouTube it came out as 480p I do not know if it’s because of YouTube or CapCut. Another. Suggestion is more smooth transitions there are a lot of smooth ones but I feel you egoism maybe make a setting to change it to like pro editors for us to make some more smoother edits. I also suggest more stock videos for like intros! That’s all I love this app and definitely recommend
5,MiMicats12,"If I could give out an award to the best editing app, this one would definitely be my first choice. This app is amazing! From the fonts of the words to the unique animations, CapCut easily is the greatest editing app you could possibly download. But here’s the thing that will be the best for y’all in college struggling to pay your tuition and all you can do to make money is create YouTube videos: The app is free! Honestly, I was surprised and amazed on how incredible this app was when I first got it. I’m not trying to shame other editing apps, but CapCut easily takes the win for best editing app. Five stars to you! Bravo!"
5,rainbow high fan ✌︎︎,so people in youtube kept saying that capcut was bad so i wanted to try it out and i do not regret it. whenever i make new edits with capcut i watch them more that at least 5 times an hour bc they are so good! have a nice day to whoever is reading and happy 4th of july!
5,Senpaiisbsbebdd,"With all the features you get with this app is amazing. No watermark, except at the end which can be removed. There are so many amazing features that can be used for things such as youtube. Thanks for this amazing app."
5,Evvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvva,My friend showed me this app when we were filming a video. I have always wanted to have a YouTube career and now I can!!! CapCut has the cutest images and gifs. It even has the subscribe button image. You can add music and it is so easy definitely recommend!!!!

4,@ily.kyroq,"Few Suggestions… So far for a few months I’ve been loving this app and my videos have been getting more popular every time I upload and people love it, I love it! So far no problems with this app, but I do have a few suggestions for the app that would make more people download this app.  -Make it so we can fade out effects like so they just don’t cut off Like the text animations but for the effects! -Audio, just like Videoleap with the different selected audio effects.  Overall I love this app! 🔥 —@ily.kyroq"

3,??? da bear,"I love it,I can make yt video’s easily,edit easily,basically,it’s amazing. But,one time I pressed “create project” and it’s said my storage was full! So I went to clean some stuff up,first I deleted an app that was very big,still said it. So I went to settings and,well,it said it wasn’t full. I restarted my ipad,still.said.it.

5,enespanolnina,This app has helped me so much I love it so much it’s helping my YouTube channel rise through the roof I can’t believe that I found this app I am so happy that this app is a thing I have no idea what I could do without it
3,tonyaterry,I gave it 3 stars because sometimes when I can’t edit people say eww you use cap cut in 2020-2021 I’m like sorry I can’t help it so I went on to vsp.
5,Happy Penny 56,This app is amazing.At first I only used this app called clips but since then I’ve been using this app.I’m a very bad writer so this may feel short or long tbh idk.I just want the creators to know their app is amazing.I hope many people find this and use it as well as give great reviews!
4,randomdude2,"So I’ve used this app for over a year to make my YouTube videos and I’ve got to admit it. This app is AMAZING! But there’s one thing about it that can be very annoying.. it takes awhile to load when you choose the picture/video you want in the video. So I would usually use a different app to make my video then use this app for affects, but for me this is a great app for affects!"
5,beans are cute,This app is super good for me I can make super cool edits on my YouTube and it is super easy to learn how to use it. Everyday I learn a new way to use it

5,briiiiiiiiiiiii😌🇲🇽🇲🇽,I personally love this app.💜but I hope the slowmo could be a little more smother this is no hate.and the effects I love them and I love how it’s free
5,YofavNa-Na,"It’s a good app, the bad reviews are from people who don’t know how to use it. (youtube vids for that) I would like to request the exploding text like after effects and I wish it would stop being laggy after adding text and overlays. Thanks for the app!"
5,lovelillyb😛,"why should you? bc it’s just plain old AMAZING! You don’t even know how many Roblox edits and edits in general I’ve made. I can’t even describe how badly I LOVE THIS FREAKING APP. You can remove the watermark in KineMaster you have to pay in CapCut it’s free. You get so many transitions, stickers, effects, and so much more! It’s easy to use and fun! You can extract audio from videos you’ve recorded. And if you have tiktok (I dont) you can extract audios you’ve saved. It works on phone and iPad and is really helpful for YouTubers. One of my favorite youtubers uses this app. It’s my favorite app the app that takes up all my battery. And my screen time. Its easy and fun and I love it so much, have I mentioned that I love this freaking app? Lol. Me and my best friend both love this app. I’m still a little confused about overlays, but I’ll get the hang of it. I had to get rid of a lot of apps to clear storage and now Roblox and like Netflix and YouTube and others are my only fun game apps now. But I still love CapCut. I’m telling you, CapCut is my FAVORITE FREAKING APP. To summarize it, CapCut is easy and fun. Useful and sweet. You can make lots of things and edits and stuff. I love this app. idk how many times I’ve said I love this app, but I LOVE THIS APP. I definitely recommend this app. Best editing app ever. I’ve grown in my edits. And this app is like SO FREAKING GOOD OMG. You NEED TO GET THIS APP. if your an editor, get this app. If your a tiktoker, get this app. if your a bored person who wants to do something productive but not like cleaning your room or bathroom, get this app. EVERYONE GET THIS APP. Thank you for reading. :)"
3,No<33333333333333333,I cant with this app anymore- I was trying to make a video for YouTube and I was importing photos for something that I needed and it just said “sorry didn’t work try again later” LIKE- WHAT-😀 EXCUSE ME YOU YES YOU CAPCUT YOU MADE ME DELETE OVER 300+ OF MY HARD WORKING PROJECTS THAT TOOK OVER 1360 HOURS TO DO FOR THE PAST 2 1/2 YEARS-.  IM SWITCHING BACK TO KINEMASTER!
5,Ssjb Goku Son,"Capcut is amazing. Don’t get me wrong, but it seems to be missing something. I’ve seen that some people on either a Google pixel or some other android device have the ability to make their own template and use it. iOS users on the other hand, do not have the ability to do this, and it would be really useful if we could, in my opinion. I am a small content creator on tiktok, and I would love to see this implementation for iOS."
4,Bee da merry,I would like to say that 1 thing should do is add more text fonts from the (dafont.com ) and like how alight motion feature text and I think it would change the game if it did that.
5,•🌸Fxolowerx🌸•,It is amazing I can post YouTube or tik tok video+insta and that’s amazing I love it
5,your ugley,"It has everything you need built in music stickers Crome key all for free!I think you should let people us the app even if they have bad storage and just download it later.Anyways I also think some tutorials would go really well cause my brother his skills are all right, not the best.Same with some of my friends to.That’s all bye!"
4,StizzieStiz,I raved about the captioning feature but it is no longer working. I updated the app and reinstalled but the captioning feature is still unavailable

5,ZXS500988,I don’t have a YouTube account yet but when I do I’ll sponsor you in my videos this is the best editing app I’ve used yet I just want to say one more thing the only problem is that I’m making an animated series with my gotcha characters and I really need to add  More overlays than you allow me to so can you do that it would be really helpful for my gotcha in my channel and that’s mostly the only problem I have but thank you for this app it’s amazing :)
5,kittycutie4456,This app is so good it really helps me with my YouTube videos and I love it download this app right now!!!!!
5,stitchahalic,THE BEST EDITING APP I HAVE EVER HAD!!! I did not have any problems with it so far and it is very easy to use.3000% recommend.
5,Silver Kiwi,"Like 1,2,3-4-5/6/7/8/9>>>>>>>10000000000"
5,Candy Frost🍬,I first when I downloaded this app I was confused how to use it with the help of YouTube it helped me a lot to do amazing and approval edits! 100% recommend❤️✨😃
4,Gio and Eddie,"Hello this a good app totally recomendable if u just started editing, it’s easy to use and fun.but... there is still stuff it is missing it needs more voice effects because just have it high and low isint a lot,maybe a wavy type of effect kinda like in tic tok it also needs more effects for vids because sometimes I looking for something and I can’t find it maybe try adding a echo but if ur reading this try downloading it it’s good other then what I just said it’s a perfect app. Have a good day"

5,Fallen_Dreamz,"Review:  I’ve been using CC for a couple of months now and between then and now I’ve greatly improved in my edits and I honestly appreciate the app for helping me get more experienced in getting creative. Edits can be so much more than just slapping a couple of pre-made transitions and calling it a day if you just experiment with your options a lot more.  I actually find it fun editing in CC rather than frustrating or exhausting. Sure, it may take an hour, an entire day or an entire night to get it done but it’s definitely worth it if you enjoy it.  The mechanics are easy to understand and most of the time things don’t get messy (such as undoing a keyframe and having the clip zoomed in, or adjusting the masking and having it stuck in at a certain limit, or editing an overlay with a splice added and having the outside completely black.)  Those were just some nitpicks. Oh, and a major issue to me is the lag depending on how complex the edit is or how much overlays are included. Not only does the preview freeze, the audio glitches out real bad. I’m currently typing this out just right when I updated the app right when I began this review. So hopefully that issue might’ve been dealt with, or at least some of the others.  I don’t really have much to say, but it’s overall positivity about the app. Now, about the new template feature.  Template Feature:  I’m not sure as to why this is, but Android users seem to be the only people able to access the ability to create templates and view others while iOS users (such as myself) can only use templates from the Shortcut area. I’m hoping that at some point this feature will release for iPhone users, I think it’d be fun creating templates for others to use!  That’s just one possibility. Either it’s only actually available for Android users or the iPhone I’m using is too outdated to be able to create templates. Which I hope isn’t the case.  This is much more short, but it was the main reason why I wrote down this review. I just thought I should include my actual thoughts on the app entirely as well.  That’s all from me, thank you for reading and please excuse any grammatical errors (I always miss those)."
5,kiwi weird,Alright so I used to use iMovie it really sucked but when I heard about capcut on tictok I had to get it capcut is making me obsessed so now I use capcut all the time and I rate capcut 1000000/4 don’t get me wrong it’s a good app so if you want to edit get capcut✨
5,ushshsgsyysys,This has really helped me with my YouTube channel and I read it a five star because it’s one of the best editing apps for mobile and it’s so fun enjoyable and it’s 100% free no buying stuff in the app no subscription and it’s the best app I’ve probably ever used for editing <3
5,linda love bt21,This is great and very useful for TikTok videos.CapCut makes me go so viral.
5,jerseythecat,This app is like heaven I love it! You need to get a 100000/10
4,💖V💖,"Hello! I just wanted to say you should DEFINITELY DOWNLOAD THIS APP! It’s really great for making edits, also you can make YouTube videos and intros on there! Also really great to improve you picture editing skills! It has sound effects, and you can make sound effects, But the reason why I take off a star is because it’s SUPER sensitive to storage, like I cleared 167 pictures from my camera roll and it stills says my storage is full which I VERY frustrating, is there a chance you guys can fix that? Anyways it’s pretty good app besides that issue, I for sure recommend downloading. 🙂"
1,ihatelife324,The developers constantly shoving this app’s ads in my face pretty much sums up why I can’t be bothered to use their content.
2,Lipaoq,I’ve recorded a lot of Audio from YouTube and it usually works out but sometimes it doesn’t I would like to know why this happens.
4,subway tik tok addicted,I love this app it’s amazing for my edits like roblox and gacha life!It helps out so much!!But whenever I’m not making a gacha life edit when I am making a gacha episode or movie it’s bad for it why?Because I need to add layers of stuff but because the limit it’s so hard to do it and it’s challenging.But overall the app is great I’ve had great experiences with it
2,😁👌🏻👍🏻👍🏻,The app is pretty dope but when I tried to edit it keep saying I didn’t have enough space and then I deleted like 200-300 things and it still said it.
5,_Wavy_Baby,I got over 1000 views doing CapCut edits on YouTube and when I first started I was a beginner and I used CapCut now tons of people ask me to do edits for them. So it’s an amazing app to use for beginners or advanced
5,Rudy775,I’d like to request if you could allow Spotify music in here to there are a lot of songs I have that are part of gacha memes so please get this request thank love the app ❤️
1,Blxxmingmoonlight,Guys don’t use this app it’s a waste of time! I recommend this app for only people who use tik tok not YouTube though! I don’t recommend it for YouTube for only 2 reasons! It’s lags and scenes. it lags by sometimes not showing you can put the text and overlay stuff and adding scenes it just layers instead which is very annoying! I don’t know if some of you got my problem but I think you should use KineMaster! It better and doesn’t lag and do all bad stuff like KineMaster and other apps! 😡😡😡😡 Fix the app and I will give it a 2 Btw this use to be my fave editing app but it isn’t because of all of these reasons. So ya don’t install it or download it
4,Creative Wolf,It’s a great app! I love doing anime edits and posting them on YouTube. But most of the time they don’t turn out great. I don’t know if it’s because I don’t use all the tools it has or it just needs more. I wish they had more animations too. Overall it’s a good app.
5,DeCaf.,"I absolutely love this app! I use it to make skits and videos and even my own TikTok's! This app made me love editing! Anyways, as I was editing a video earlier today, I was thinking “I wish this app had a heart button so you can heart your favorite videos! Also, it would be cool to add a “Public” video. Basically meaning that once you've made a video, you can choose to make it visible to other people on CapCut! Also, along with the visible idea, you can make it like YouTube and TikTok where you can like other peoples videos and subscribe or follow people! That would be a great addition! You can also add something like a chat button to give your thoughts and stuff like that. Anyways, back to what I like about this app. For me, this is like my own YouTube channel. Im not allowed to have a real one, but this app makes me feel like I do! It has pre made stickers that you can insert, it has text features and even voice effects! I used to edit with iMovie, and I really loved it until one day I was scrolling on YouTube, and i pressed on this video. I looked at their description and I saw that they used this app! I decided to download and once it was installed, I spent two hours testing out the features and editing. I have made over 70 videos within a span of two months! And the best part about it is that it is all free! No subscription, no money, nothing! And no ads! I would definitely recommend this app for people who are small YouTubers or editors. This app really makes my day. Shoutout to all the CapCut developers for making this app one that I will keep forever! Can’t wait to see what updates will come in the future!"
5,Thousand percent good,This is the best and easy editing app to use the edits I do make me proud of all the great hard work I did this app is amazing my favorite part Is when I add the music and I had an idea if you could PLEASE add any type of music like if I wanted Taylor Swift music I type it up and it’s their so please add that anyway so this is an amazing app so please Please add the update I wanted am begging cause it’s getting really annoying that I have to go on YouTube and screen record the hole song and I just get bored so please add that update sometimes the music video is long and it might even take 1 Hour!!
5,Yaeisha,I recently made a YouTube channel and use this to make Harry Potter edits and I already have 1k. This app is awesome and I really recommended it!
3,Yakooosa,Well I would say that I love CapCut be I can’t even get into the app.But have a wonderful day
5,A Random Nuggets Review,Everything is good the effects and everything i love the chroma key this app really helps me with my YouTube videos for editing them this app is insane 5 star review from me i cannot believe how awesome this app is
4,michael neill,"I absolutely LOVE this app. It is super helpful for TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, etc. There is a HUGE variety and so much to choose! There are many styles of videos you can make and it is super open to use! It’s not too hard either, it’s super easy to navigate and it’s really fun to use. One thing I wish they would improve are their fonts. The fonts in their text just aren’t enough or the style I’m looking for. I wish you could download your own fonts into the app. And make it more YOUR style instead of using green screens and stuff. Other than that I 100% recommended this app. It’s truly works dreams."
4,kyaac,when are we gonna have the same features as android capcut? i’ve seen there is a lot of features that has not yet been implemented in the ios version of capcut..
4,i live solitare,"I love Capcut, I use it all the time.But here are a few suggestions:  •add ""apply all"" effect to text  •when i import the video it sometimes messes up the quality  •maybe a few more fonts  •more animations for the fonts  •specific cropping, like not just the borders but being able to erase things  •when using the slide in animation for text go one line at a time instead of the whole paragraph   •add an option for text to fade in letter by letter"
4,ok this is trash,I love using this app but there is one problem I can’t post to youtube that is one of the main reasons I got this app but I can’t do that
2,unknwon.,I redownloaded it and turned off my WiFi and everything.and powered off my device but it seems that when I go to animation or filters and stuff like that it keeps saying internet connection problem when my WiFi is full bars? And I can’t get it to work which is very stressful. And I like using this app but it just somehow started glitching.
5,unicorn crazy girl,I absolutely love this app. I edit all my YouTube videos and other just small edits on here. I definitely suggest this app for beginner YouTubers like myself or someone who just wants to edit videos. If you don’t know how to work something YouTube has been many tutorials on how to easily fix that problem you don’t know of. This is my all-time favorite app other than social media because it all free. I hate how other apps make you pay for certain things or you have a limit of something. This doesn’t and I am super glad.
5,ilikeitsfunnehbecauseshefunneh,This app is a really good mobile editing software I use to edit my videos for my YouTube channel and the transitions are smooth the effects and best of all there is no watermark and you can delete the ending frame at the end this app has many more features but I suggest you download this app is you like to edit thank you you app developers for making this app😝🤙
5,iamavampireblehblehbleh,i love capcut it’s helped me with my k*ceytron hate edits <3 go follow me on tiktok @idoxenon
2,Prottoy Saha,Okay so my review is only that why does it takes up to 3GB storage? The app size is just 107MB now I deleted it again downloaded it and then saw same thing!  I just save my storage! Now here’s my storage used and can use USED 28.2GB  CAN USE 224.48GB  Ikr that why am I arguing with too lower storage used? 1 month ago I used 255.8GB STORAGE and also can use only 2MB  But I also don’t want to delete this app Cuz the normal font is really amazing 🥺 Btw please do not take more storage than 4GB  Pleaseeeee....!
4,15xstar0,"Other that the amount of transitions , the app is great.What I suggest it mora transitions and effects and it would be kinda cool if you could add transitions when there’s only one video .Also, about the animation button I wish it wasn’t always in the beginning like it could be in the middle of the video.Anyways creator(s) I hope you see this."
5,philleoau,This was a really good app best mobile one thats for free😺😋🙃😎 super good app. This is basically free adobe.And by the way relchef  you’re phone or iPad or whatever device you have its probs like an iPhone 5 try and get a better one maybe that will work and the it wont be so laggy.And Jeff you can fade it and you also can control how fast it is.And also i think that this app should come with instructions because i have no clue. How to use the chroma key but i saw it on YouTube and i dont know what the betouch is either some of the stuff are to hard to understand.I also think they should do updates just for fun.
5,Mariahs Review of Roblox,"Hello,I really like using CapCut because it has a lot of effects and it’s free.But a lot of other apps have these color rays like Video Star,but I don’t know how to use Video Star so I use CapCut but I was wondering and hoping if you guys can add “color rays”like multiple color rays in the party slot Thank you!."
5,cole_sprouse's_wife,"capcut is amazing. I make awesome edits to where it looks like it’s from after effects. It’s free, no watermark, AWESOME effects you can do such as intros for youtube vids or even making you edits reversed, adding text with animation, and countless more. Any song is free, WHICH IS CRAZY. you just have to screenrecord a song and save it to your camera roll and bam, you can use it. It doesn’t take too long to get the hang of it either, it’s just awesome."
5,GamerBD12,At first I want say that  the developer of this app are so amazing.And it’s the best mobile video editing app.Thanks Developers❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
5,- ملاحظه -,It’s amazing five star but there’s a problem ... Why when I adjust the photo and make it short It does not take me to where the chroma key and animations mask and stuff like that when you put the effects it’s annoying please fix it I’m not hating but I would love it if you fixed it and it’s also hard to click on the short photo it shows you to flitter overall it’s a great app love it glad this app is available for iOS and android but fix the problem it’s okay if you don’t understand try to understand as much as possible you don’t have to understand it tho but perfect app thank you for your time❤️❤️
5,Meleie,This app is amazing I ♡ it I used it for my YouTube channel it’s call hawks big sister I ♡ this app it’s worth it I just tried it today and I got it all by myself it’s very easy it’s worth it buy it now everyone!
4,An bootiful potato,"The app is great in general just depends on your editing skill.It’s great for beginners and very easy and explains how to do everything.Although it may kick you out in a middle of a project but that’s mainly because storage space and CapCut is great on letting you know. But really besides that the app is great! It gives you tuns of stickers filters and more, also let’s you take Audio from your videos in your storage or cloud ( apple) . In general I love this app and I’d change nothing"
5,Uhsed,"I just want to say, this is probably the best video editing app! No watermark, no video limit, cool transitions and effects. Only one thing that kinda bugs me. Whenever I export a video to 1080p and 60fps, on YouTube it says it is 48fps instead of 60. I’m not sure why that happens but that’s my only issue. Everything else is fine! Thank you for this amazing app."
5,kimira ✨🌈,This app is amazing and I would suggest it for anyone looking for good content on social media apps such as YouTube and TikTok. I use this 24/7 and I’m so happy with the outcome of my videos. There is one thing I would recommend adding with the key frame. I would like there to be choices on how it moves kind of like cute cut. I’ve always wanted that app but my mother said no. It would make my day so much better if you added that.   Thank you for reading this!!!❤️❤️
1,I CAN'T PLAY!!!!!!!!!,I CANT EVEN EDIT.I was making a extra long video for yt.And when I went to edit it said I needed to FREAKING free up space!!!!Like I was so triggered🙄.
5,bella game girl,I literally love this app. I use it for a silly reason. I use this to edit my tiktoks and my YouTube videos. It helps sooo much. Do not listen to the bad comments. Get it NOW it’s a great app.
5,overall so great love it,I have been struggling with editing apps.Until I found cap cut.
5,..twinklestar,"Capcut is a really good editing app! You guys should try I, I really recommend you too. But there’s one thing I wanted to say, I believe that you guys should upgrade the app where there’s a search button.   Why I said this is because, it’s difficult for me and some others to find the right effect or what exactly they are looking for. I’m not saying that it’s just wasting peoples time. But I’m saying that it would be a quicker way for everyone,   The filters are good, but I had this idea where for the “Blur” effect, I was thinking for some editors including me. Where we would want to edit something and have the background blurred out, that way it would be easier For most of us.and The “Chromic/Chromo” (forgot name) But I was thinking that it would have this effect where it can chromic the background outline.  But once again its a really good app I hope everyone else enjoys the app like I do, it would be an honor if you guys would take my idea( you don’t always have too) but I hope this would make you guys have more ideas when there a new updates!💗"
5,WHODATDERRE,YOU😉CAN👁LEAD🤠THE💀WAYYYYY✋
5,GACHA LOVER 756,"CapCut is the best editing app out there.It has all the tools you need to make the edit you want,it’s all free too!"
5,Trash. Absolute trash.,"THIS APP IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! NO WATER MARK, AND ITS NOT HARD TO USE!!!!!!😫😫😫😫😫😚😚😚😚😊😊😊😊💕😉😉😉😉😉💕💕💕🍡🍡💜💜💜💜🌸🌸🌸🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🍡🍡🍡🍡🍡🌈🌈🌈🍀🍀🍀☘️☘️😫🌷🌷🌺🌺🍪🍪🍕🍕🍕😚🍡😫💕💐💙☘️🗡💐💜😫💕🌷😉⚡️😉☺️😘☺️🧐😝😋🙃🧐😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝"
5,kein bb,"This is an amaazzing editing app for beginners, especially if you make AMV's. Everything is free, and the effects are lovely. Theres a variety of choices and i even use it to edit youtube videos. I found this app because of the ""Sugar Crush"" trend, and it was an amazing editor. However I have a couple suggestions. The app runs smoothly and there's no bugs or anything, but i'd invest in adding animations to nearly anything. For example: effects. Adding effects without no ""fade in"" looks choppy. :) thanks  -Alfred"
5,ItsFuryYT,"So I use this for my YouTube and eve since I started using CapCut I started getting better feedback. I just wish it was compatible for the original iPad (4th Gen) If you could make it compatible, that would be AWESOME!"
3,cool biswa vong,I love this app so much for my YouTube and my Fortntie montages! But there’s a laggy glitch it makes my videos really laggy. And I can’t put the effects. If I put the shakes in the montage it makes it lagger and if I put it on slow motion it makes it for laggy. Is there anyway to fix it..
4,TandreChew,I love everything about the app the effects the velocity’s everything except the volume cap if Videoleap had all these features that CapCut does I would switch to Videoleap because Videoleap has a volume up to 500 I’m not switching to video leap because of the less features but if this had one last feature being such a volume cap higher then the current I would love this app ten times more plz it doesn’t even have to be 500 300 and I would give this a perfect 5 stars
5,💘 E'lin 💘,I love this app and I definitely recommend it I think it is better to make funny YouTube videos on it like you can change your voice and that’s really cool! Hey also have keyframes and I love that! I just think they should make a custom graph option to mma who ur edits even better! And Overall I love this app!
1,digdeer,"Today when I was I need a video for my YouTube channel, this app said that my iCloud has overflowed and it Will no longer let me use the app I am deleting this. 1 star 😐"
5,iris8LiN,"I love this app, it got me a bit successful on YouTube and Tik Tok. There’s overlaying and animations but there’s a few things that can be added but isn’t exactly necessary. When uploading the pictures, we have to click on them one by one instead of sliding it and picking it all at once (that might’ve not make sense), another that could be added is loop animations. Like the camera swinging but not switching to another picture. Hope this all makes sense"
5,Lizzy Afton Fan,It’s the best app I’ve ever used and it’s so good for everything when you send it to your friends and you will get the best rating on YouTube from it!
5,AdorblyOlivia (Thats my yt),"I totally recommend capcut, the features are amazing and great quality and the best part is no watermark. I also love it for my YouTube videos I always edit and create my thumbnails on it, totally recommend my YouTube is: AdorblyOlivia 🦋"
5,panda_squad_kat181,"Capcut is amazing! It’s easy to use even though sometimes thing are hard to do! I personally think capcut is better than most other apps. I definitely prefer capcut more than video star or ae. Capcut is free. The app is free and everything you do on it is completely free! Yes, the transitions are pre-made, but that’s a good thing! You don’t have to waste so much time making the transition yourself. You can do overlays and effects. You can trim the clips. You can add free sounds from other videos. And you can do really cool key frames! You can also make transitions by using the key frames! You can do so much stuff and there’s a huge variety of versions of different things! The only problem about capcut is the ads. You’re making us look bad! You ARE the app itself and even we know how to use it better than you! Please make better ads! Love you 😘   ps. One time I was editing a miraculous cat noir video and then I turned into cat noir 😰🥵😩😍"
4,Iamelyssah,I have been using capcut for more over a year now and I got to say this is by far one of the best free editing apps for mobile phones I will start with what I like/achieved so I like how there are a variety of effects transitions and more they aren’t bad at all there very decent and you could make a good edit with them I have been making edits from capcut and I have built a platform of over 8K followers with these edits so thanks and also I want to talk about some things that I think can be improved like first the quality the quality of videos aren’t that bad but it’s not The neatest so it would be nice to have a smoother edit then for transitions it would be nice to have more specific customization like if I wanted to do a spin I would like to rearrange the key frames and have more control also can you add more transitions like more creative ones but of course I would like to have more customization options so that’s it but basically the app is pretty good especially for new editors and I just ask if more customization also if any of you need help or tips you can find me here: @Mjngifxuff (tell me you need help with capcut) thankyou for Reading this! 💜
5,nnita6262,Hi!So today at the morning and also yesterday i just found out a star 1 and star 2 filter and i liked so much i used to edit a lot of vids with it.But today after editing a vid it got deleted  and i cried about it bc i liked it a lot also i thinked if its was deleted just to my phone but it is to my best friends phone too. So please can you add that effect back!
4,JayClimm,Don’t get me wrong the bling is cool and all but most of them like Moonlight doesn’t work properly.But it cloud use some blinging.
5,SNL TJ,"Bro this app is awesome and on top of that it’s FREEEE!! I know editing apps that cost money that are no where near this good and it’s free. I love this app. 5/5, good for editing videos and if you want to become and editor for YouTube videos or make quick edits this is perfect I already have like 7 edits and everyone likes it and ask me what I edit with."
1,Brooklyn Joyce,I use it for my YouTube videos and it takes way to long to load it I try to put more then 6 video clips
5,judge rudyy,"I love this app so much! I got this app because I have a tiktok account (@earth.activist) and when I wanna use a green screen to show images it doesn’t let me because it has to have a certain measurement to fit the screen, but i can do all that in CapCut. Adding the text is so much better too, it has sooooo many different effects for the text. Giving the text an animation, MANY different fonts to use, a bunch of different colors to use, and many more. I also love the transitions they put for each clip, they always fit the occasion of vid I wanna do. This app is amazing!  -Martina  Ps. Go follow @earth.activist on tiktok so YOU can be educated on our planet earth 🌍"
5,unicornpupwolves,"this is absolutely the best editor app. it doesn’t lie, this is easy to use. the transitions are amazing, and it makes my animation memes 1000 times better. if you want to check out my animation memes, my yt channel is bubbly.pancakes"

5,iirye,"Ok so it’s an amazing app.it only took me like 2 days to get the hang of it. The transitions,the effects,the stickers,the filters,etc. i have made so many videos with it and edits with it,I personally think it’s way easier than any other editing app.it’s amazing and I really recommend for editors,especially beginners. I don’t currently have a problem with it. Thanks for reading my review!❤️"
5,51636373828,I use this app for tik tok edits and YouTube videos I absolutely love it! And it’s free!

5,Kahrlohs,Capcut is an amazing app.  I recently became aware of this app and I edited my first video on it.  My first video on Capcut that I produced on it achieved 1K views on YouTube in only 2 days.  I hope the developer continues to support this app.  Absolutely an amazing app.  👍

4,Ruta and Chase,"i love this app so much, i use it for multi-layer things and for my wm! it’s helps so much, anyway, i feel like you should add this update: downloading fonts! like with video star and vont, you go to dafont.com and down the font you want, then add it to capcut!!! i’ve tried to do it before, but it didn’t work, ty and bye!"
5,25xrxsez,I do roblox edits for YouTube. I love using this app because it’s so easy to understand and get the hang of!!
5,hzjsnsksn,"Okay, Do there is so many things about the apps you can love. First of all, THERES NO WATERMARK!! Like omg- Secondly there’s a part at the end that you can just like take off.

I mean- you can do layers, text, audio, transactions, etc. if you are looking for a app to edit YouTube videos, or photos this is the app for you! I’m sorry for the short review but this app is amazing!"

5,BeastOfficial,Ayo this app go hard I’ve been looking for one to start my YouTube channel 10/10 would recommend
5,Jane Mayah,"This is very amazing. I can do any intros for my fans on youtube! You know what? I should say...this is AMAZING, GOOD, I’m in love with this app. I don’t like Any apps like, KineMaster, I don’t know any apps like that. And I should say roblox, Phonto, and CapCut IS THE BEST. I’m freaking in love with this app!!!!!!! Love it. Keep up the amazing fabulous nice work. But, I wanted to test my gacha life characters and put it on CapCut and put it on a pink or any background and I remove my gacha life characters background, it turns black...So can you fix it?? Thank you. Love this app."
5,user1232146864336895422,I really like this app and I think it’s very easy to use and it has good quality but I wish there was a way to be able to just search up an effect or filter.otherwise I love this app and that’s why I give it 5 stars
5,FrameDrop32,"i’m a very small content creator who likes to make small minecraft videos but i needed a good video editor with no watermark. I saw this app from an ad on youtube so i downloaded it and loved it. It had everything i needed for a good quality video, all for free."
5,romedog121 friend me on cd,THX TYSMMMMMM
5,Unicornbananan2012,I absolutely love Caput except there  is one thing that i would like them to add.When you  want to add a text there are hood fonts to choose from but i would really like it if they added more-fonts.Also when you add a picture and press animation the Combo Animations Mwah mwah i love all the options for Animations but could you add all those animations for texts please.But besides that i love it I would recommend it for Roblox editors.Thats all i got to say about capcut and overall I-give it   a 5/5 stars.
4,I_went_yeet,"this app is really good! it has all the things editors need. the only reason why i rated this 4 stars is because i wish the app gave you tutorials. i know there are tutorials on tiktok and youtube and stuff like that, but i wish the actual APP gave you tutorials. like video star, but overall, great app✨"

5,zucc2.1,"This app is overall great but one thing I would love you to fix is the laggy ness.Once I’m done editing a video, and export it, it ends up coming out laggy and slow and not at all like how the video speed was, I didn’t lower the speed on the speed button but that’s just something that’s happens to me and would love you to fix that bug, but overall great app because it  has many useful tools for editing videos."
5,Aidan5683,This app is awesome and free love editing my Tiktoks and YouTube videos straight from my phone
4,xxxfox_loverxxx,Amazing app especially if it’s all free it’s really simple to use I love this app so much but when it comes to volume and effects it gets a little bit weird. Editing the volume doesn’t go along way and fading the volume is kinda complicated fading doesn’t  do a hole lot and really just doesn’t do the job.Doing effects is really cool but I would like if you could control the speed! Besides that overall is a really good app!If you can get past this I definitely think you should get this!
5,locket•_•,Amazing
3,Xxboba DevilxX is my yt,"I love this app it works very well when I make my YouTube videos but sometimes it says I’ll have to much space when I don’t,I had to almost delete ALL MY PHOTOS and I didn’t like that after that I stoped using the app.Also it took was way to much space in my phone to so that was the problem so download if you want it’s your choice I hope this help you decide"
4,strawberrytaeh,I love this app. It’s so easy to use! I use it for my TIk toks (twice.exe is the user) and they come out to beautiful. But I noticed that after using it I couldn’t put gifs in there anymore. They wouldn’t animate like they used to. I deleted the app and downloaded it again and it still didn’t work. Is that an update or is it storage?
5,kim taesoo,this app is literally the best. EVERYTHING is free! there is no adds! there is no scam! or cheesy filters everything is amazing! well done creators 👍🏽 👏🏽👏🏽👍🏽
5,Dice168,"This is the best editor I have ever used. My small channel took off and because my this editor was so easy to use. This editor helped me with removing the black bars from my YouTube vids and is very good with memes. I am impressed you people but the extracting music thingy and very good transitions. I can make montages for my YouTube, I can split my video instead of recording multiple times, no water mark (I used to use kinemaster and hated it because of the bad transitions and water mark. And pretty hard use if I say so. So this app has basically everything I need.) And also, I wish your app could get more populist because of how big brain you are and how this editor is like no editor I’ve seen. But there is one liiiiiiiiitle problem. The app space is a little to much for people dealing with 16 gigs of storage so can you make alittle shorter. Well it’s ok this app is fine about how amazing it is and great for small content creators. Well I hope this editing app gets more popular like inshot and I will review more soon :)<3"
5,silaa.vakaa,"I FRICKIN LOVE THIS APP  There are NO watermark whats so ever, everything is free, it’s a great app to edit videos, make edits, and it has really cool features!!! It has everything I’ve been looking for, in order for me to make a YouTube channel.. And I LOVE USING THIS APP FOR EDITING I mean why pay for an app just for editing when you can use an amazing app that is FREE such as CapCut.. I love this app it’s AMAZING! 10/10 would recommend! And if your reading this because your not sure on downloading this app.. just DOWNLOAD IT CAUSE SIS/BRO I AM TELLING YOU THIS IS AN AMAZING APP 🤍🤍🤍🤍"
5,Arielle~ :D,Ok so i got this app when i was watching a really good YouTube video and in description it showed the apps they used and one of them was capcut so i was like hey ill try it. So when i first downloaded it i looked at all the effects all the stickers and what can you do with it. And it was so amazing! Its way better than kine master or cute cut or any other video editing app in my opinion. One of the things i really like is that you can add layer over layer in the effects and keep doing it. Another thing that surprised me is that everything is literally free! I think this app is awesome and should be downloaded by so many other people! :D
5,Idk why I'm here,This app is amazing I rate it a 1000/10 it is best for edits I'm not a gacha tuber but when u use this app it doesn't have a logo or anything 100% FREE probably the best app I had ever used ✨
5,_emiilymarrr,"I’ve tried this app because I was looking for good editing apps for YouTube and I came across to this, immediately I was in shock. The functions and affects they offered were pretty good for a free app. I no longer do YouTube but I still use this app to make edits or to edit my POV’s on TikTok. I absolutely love this app so much and I’m constantly recommending it. The filter and affects they have are all free and super easy to use. They also have other functions to fit things in frame or add overlays. Overall recommend this app if you are looking for something to edit with if you don’t want to use videostar or if you are considering looking for editing apps for youtube/TikTok or whatever the case is. :)"
5,1039292929:),Amazing app follow me on tt anonymousofficiaifp
5,acmelian,"This app is easily the best video app I’ve used and it’s not as laggy compared to Alight Motion and stuff. There’s a lot of transitions and effects that are all free and I greatly appreciate that. It has keyframes as well, which would be great and a bit better if they had the graphs to edit the speed and everything. Please PLEASE add graphs. It might look hard and a bit intimidating for people who don’t know how to use them but it’s really simple and you can look up tutorials on YouTube. That’s all I’m asking for is graphs for the keyframes! Thank you!! I praise those who made this app. 💙"
5,~TruReviews~,"This video editor is amazing, and I use it for YT videos. Amazing! No watermark, every things amazing!"
5,Trey Gandy,"This is by far the best video/photo editor app I’ve ever downloaded, it has almost all of the features that a pc editor has and it’s 1080p quality, so it is perfect for high quality and slick edited YouTube videos!"
4,ok cool just wondering,"Don’t get me wrong, this app is AMAZING 🤩 I use it to edit clips of celebrities/tiktokers... and it has been a pleasure and no-stress taking app. This app got me to do my own YouTube channel. What I have noticed using it to edit long videos, it gets laggy. Like ALOT. It takes 5 seconds just to split something. I’ve tried to make it to only 16 minutes... but it’s still laggy. I love this app very much. Before the update to have access to all videos/photos it wouldn’t let me add a photo and if I did in the “edit” area when I would try to choose a new one and it wouldn’t show up. Over all this app it great! I love it so much! But this app is definitely NOT for long videos 😭 but anyways, I hope you take this into consideration, have a good day 😊"
5,heheueuhs,I rate this app 1000-10
5,Kita7711,I made some pretty nice videos with cap cut but when I put the videos to a shorter duration the pictures tend to not update as fast.Leading to my edits going off sync
5,Emmarocks237,"I downloaded this app because I saw it on YouTube. When I first got it, I didn’t really get how to edit. But it’s been only a week, and I’m already a huge step across! I absolutely love this app and the updates that have been happening. Thank you for making such a wonderful app for me to edit on!"
5,harlee-gean queen,I give this a 10/10!!! This an amazing app for editing. You can edit anything with this app and there are no water marks and it is freeeeee!! I love this app. It is not hard to edit on and the walkthrough it so helpful for when you join! Over lays and Labeling is so easy to do and it looks great with bling effect or stickers! I LOVE THIS APP!! If you are thinking of getting it get it! I love editing on it and it is just a game changer! Download it and enjoy!
5,wowwwwwww ....,i have recently been using this app for all my edits and i LOVE it! it’s been really really easy to make a edit. i rate this app a 100000/5 because it’s so easy to edit with and i absolutely LOVE THIS APP! ❤️❤️✨
5,smsethgs,I just really love this app is the best app are used to edit for my TickTock sentence because I added anime things on TickTock‘s and it’s a really good app and it’s for free for free no ads at all there’s no as is for free I never had a app that’s for free that you can use even you can delete the end  know as there’s nothing that says cup cut. And I as always go to p effect that are really easy to useAnd it’s just like the easiest Abi ever for editing to use I just got it yesterday and it was the best I have ever I love this app so much and if you’re not if you didn’t download yeah you really should download it because it’s a really good editing app that you can use for your edits for TickTock or at us for anything you want to do a YouTube or anything it has like really good on things you don’t it doesn’t take that long to do because it’s your news anything is really easy because cup cut  hasTutorials or you can find tutorials on YouTube or anything but it’s a really easy app to use so I really think you guys should use it but over layers are really easy on it you can do anything all you just need is the picture of the videos and the space but it’s a really good app there’s no at all there’s no waiting so if you didn’t download cup cut you should download because it’s a really awesome app and if you guys see this I hope you download it because it’s a awesome app and I just got it and it’s really easy for me to edit and is the best editing app ever so that’s why I rated five stars and I just love the app so much
5,mykeyworkidme12,"It’s a pretty good app and no extra charges for other stuff like effects but I have been having a problem with the app. The app isn’t “catching my wifi” I guess you can say. I can’t use transitions and can’t send feedback but everything else is working fine? (YouTube, this review lol) so is it cause of my wifi? I’m away from home and the wifi here isn’t the best nor is it as good as the wifi at my house. I don’t think it’s a wifi problem though because I’m pretty sure YouTube uses more data so is there a fix?"
5,itskatherinehere,"there's sometimes some glitches or lag, but overall, this app is amazing! it's super useful for high quality youtube videos, with professional edits, and even basic fan edits! this app helped me a lot with learning the basics of fan edits, and i've even been able to move to more complex apps like video star all thanks to this. i use this for my youtube videos still, and the overlays and texts are seriously so amazing. so much variety as well for texts, animations, and stickers. i love how incredibly easy this app is to use, and how literally EVERYTHING is free. not a single payment is included to do anything. being able to delete the outro at the end inside of the app itself is also great as well. totally recommend this app for all video editors; both beginners and even people who are experienced and are looking to make simple videos."
5,@Yvonne.Mugure,"Basically all your fav editing apps in 1. I was using 3 apps sometimes just to upload 1 TikTok video which was a little annoying. Now I can resize a video, add effects, captions and upload from the app. 100% recommend! @Yvonne.Mugure"
5,izzie~beth,"I'm a youtuber right? Yeah, I use this app to edit my videos! Over All it's AMAZING, But I wish they could add a feature for when you export the edited video you can upload it to youtube right away! Just a thought!!  Also youtube channel is {Abbiegirl299}"
5,mh133md,Ok so first off I barley write reviews but this one I have to type  The app is almost the best editing app on mobile and I love the fact that it is has no watermark unlike some apps kinemaster and others it has some flaws like languages like Arabic and others  We need more language options I use this program like everyweek Cus that’s my upload schedule on YouTube so me and others need  Other languages in the text option to make better content on  TikTok or YouTube so if someone of the devs of the app sees  This please consider it and take it in a serious way we need this  Thanks for reading this huge text 😅
3,IGHHHJFFFDIJUJJJJD,I love the app I use it everyday but today IT DELETED ALL MY SCREEN SHOTS THAT I NEEDED TO USE NOW I HAVE TO TALE THEM AGAIN
5,parrish_king,It’s so smooth and it’s free the help on this thing is crazy my new favorite app
5,XxCxxkie!,it’s amazing! i canta describe how happy i am to finally find a app that’s perfect. and it’s free which makes it 100/100 i love this keep going!

5,rowlet70,"honestly I luv the app. It helps me with my edits and I can try my best while working on it, great effects but can you maybe add more transitions and how can I share my transitions with other people using this app.one more thing maybe u can add custom graphs to control the speed of the transitions or the animations please I would like it to help me match it on beat with edits I make thank you.❤️❤️  *i hope you read this please* 🥺"
5,Everyhingsbs,"Hello! This app is honestly GOLD. this app is easy to figure out, Cute Cut, is hard to figure out so is Power Director. this app is very easy to figure out. I use it for Gacha Life videos, such as Gacha life music videos.definitly recommend! Also, the preset music is AMAZING."
2,wicodank,"So my cousin told we to download this and I did. I posted a lot on tik tok with this app. After a few months it said a have to much storage,ye I deleted some apps and photos.it still said full storage, I deleted some photos. I let me do it. And I made the video, it said too much storage, and this is the part when I get mad.I deleted the photos and I went to screen record it instead of just processing it.I clicked on it THEN IT SAID STORAGE I DELETED THE PHOTOS I  HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN,bonus: that just happend like I min ago.."
3,......sarah........,ok i don’t usually write reviews on anything but i had a problem with this app. someone suggested this app to me so i got it and i love it! it’s great! but for some reason it only lets me use it once and when i try to get back in it it’s completely frozen. it doesn’t let me do anything. i don’t know if that’s just a phone problem but i just wanted to send this to see if anyone else has had the same problem before and how to fix it.
4,questing_rice,"I enjoy capcut. It's free, and I can do stuff just like video star without paying for a pass. And it's the only app I have to make edits 🥲🥲 Anyways, I also want to talk about the bad things about capcut. 1. I don't know if anyone gets this but when I am in the editing process, the transitions that I make are perfectly lined up with the beat. But, when I save it, it goes way off beat. This only happened when I had the app for like 2 weeks then it started doing this. 2. The beat marker system. Though it would be hard considering this is an app for mobile use, when i'm trying to mark the beats of an audio and the audio has fast beats, it would delete the beat I made previously before the beat, making it harder. 3. Key frames. I really like the use of key frames, but I think it may can use a little upgrading. When I use a key frame without any transitions, it looks weird and a little robotic. I was expecting more of a flowy movement, but it was just robotic and stiff, you know? When I use it with a transition, it makes the transition look weirder. Like the transitions become more robotic and not as flowy. And, I think that key frames can also customize the transition being put onto the video. So let's say we use a key frame for the beginning of a video. And one at the end. We can use a little bar that can control the transition amount at the end of the key frame so it can be a little like what we want. 4. Animation Extension. I think it would be cool if we can make movements in images. Like a photo of someone and then the arm is moving. Or a photo of an anime character and we make their mouth move. I guess we can kind of do that, but we would need multiple apps too do that. Also, we can make the photos wavy after a transition between 2 photos. And then add like a bounce effect after that. And, we can distort the photos with the song. So for example, during a part of a song, we pull on someone's eye ball, and it distorts that in the direction of where you pull it. But it would be better if you had like a certain section for that.And finally 5. Custom Filters. When I mean custom filters, i'm talking about 2 things. One, how fast a certain filter goes. So let's say the Back Flash filter from the Party section. We can customize to make the back flash go faster than usual or slower than usual. And two, we can change the ""noise level"" (grainy photos).  I'm so sorry for the long review but I really hope that you can look over this :)) 🥰🥰"
4,anyel maldonado,"I love this app like I’m in love ima use it for my YouTube channel! 100 % FREE no watermark great it’s easy to use outgoing I’m still snooping around the app but it’s good for editing , YouTube videos  ,and making a edit for ur idol I’m in love love love but a tip is in stock videos I want them to add memes and for YouTube vlogs but so on its great and amazing so u HAVE to use it"
4,Strxberri_bxba,I haven’t used it yet but I already know it’s great!im following a YouTube tutorial of how to do the among us live wallpaper! Tysm for making this app!
5,queengotskills,"This is helping me SO MUCH with my youtube channel videos, and the crazy thing being THIS IS ALL FREE?!? wow! it’s just so amazing and great for editing"
5,Angelyca R.,"This is literally the best editing app ever. Think I’m crazy? Check it for yourself. Last time I saw everyone using kinemaster. It’s a great app, but I lot of people complain about the watermark. So do I, I try to find editing apps with as small watermarks as possible. Great thing that CapCut has an option to remove the watermark. This app helps me with all my YouTube videos and school projects. Awesome quality also! I would recommend this app to anyone, it’s amazing!"
5,OreoKween,"I’ve been using multiple apps to edit videos for years, and this app makes editing and transitions very easy and accessible and I super appreciate it! But I have just one suggestion that may really well round the app out! With transitions, sometimes they stop a bit abruptly when it gets to the end of the transition time, but there are things that could be implemented that could offer more for the people on the fence about which app to use! Something that could fix, or at least customize, how the transition ends could be if there was a transition curve added to the app! It doesn’t necessarily need to be the type that a person can specifically alter every aspect of the transition rate, but perhaps a dozen set curves to get people started! I great example of this kind of thing can be seen of CuteCut or CuteCutPro, when you make a transition and scroll to the right of the transition options, it gives set transition curves to smooth, bounce, or alter the curve of the transition, which makes them smoother most of the time! I’m not sure how much of a pain in the butt this would be to implement, but I wanted to mention it!"
5,Hands and soap,You helped me so much this app is so ez and great for edits ILYSM love this app recommend it 147833839293839/10
3,Ruffeltgefogo,Capcut is an amazing app!! I love I make all my edits here and it’s very simple to use!!! I just have a couple suggestions!! When I make projects it says I have no storage at all but I do.. it gets pretty annoying I have to constantly delete apps or just reinstall it.another suggestion is on video star  they have these “rainbow” effects maybe you could add something similar to that!? Thank you!!!☺️
5,strawbxrry.hannah,So im a 9 yr old and i rlly love to edit i was inspired by my brother  (he also do edits) and then one day he told me to make a youtube channel if u like so i have one now so before I downloaded so many editing apps and ALL of this them have a water mark and yeah but what i rlly recommend is that pls put more fonts but overall its 100% amazing so if somebody is looking at this review pls i if you want to edit ur vids download this app its so easy and thx for making this app it rlly amazing             (P.S. pls put a beginner tutorial for new ones) Alright bye now ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ
4,Phantøm_Phøenix2048,"I’ve been using Capcut for my videos on Youtube for a few months (almost a year) now, and I think it’s really good. There aren’t any ads, it doesn’t constantly bother you to get a monthly trial, and there’s no watermark to get in the way of the video. But I have 4 problems with it. #1, it takes up A LOT of space on my device. #2, the videos are cropped in a strange way and I can’t change it. #3, the video turns out kind of blurry when I export it. You can still understand what’s going on, but less. and #4 there isn’t a dark mode. It’s very blinding especially when I’m editing at night. I’m giving this app 4 stars because aside from those things, it’s better than any other editing app I’ve ever used."
4,subbielierw,This app is amazing but one bug happened and it won’t let me press the effects button or the sticker as well.I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it but it still doesn’t work.can you please tell me why
5,Ads are mean,I love this app 100%. I use it 24/7 with all the edits I make it works great. Non of my other editing apps are like this Because this has so many features to pick from to animation and to effects. This is a great app anybody that does not have it should try this app out because this app will be used ALOT if you have a tik tok or a YouTube channel that you do tutoriols on it will help ALOT to grow! So this app will be used a lot so that’s why I rate it full stars and no complaints. This app is so underrated all my friends think I’m so good at editing now!!!
5,best USA game,I love this app but when you go to blur a video can you put a bar like how much you want it to blur if that makes sense.all together is a really nice app I use it for my videos and is really easy.
5,_deD3,Shiiiii I love this app(mostly because it’s free)but ayy it slaps because most editing apps you got to pay for and even if you don’t have to the editing is trash if you don’t have the membership.But luckily I found capcut and now I don’t need to pay no membership yessir
4,Midnight9860,"Ok, don't get me wrong, I love this app! it's very easy to use and get used to. I do have a suggestion though, maybe we could have some kind of flashing option for text, overlays ect. so you don't have to find an overlay flashing on instagram, youtube ect."
5,KIKI010203,"This app was shown to me on a YouTube channel and I tried it and I love this app cause other apps I use to have were kinemaster I loved that app but I don’t like the title in your videos on the corner it bugs me to see that, But this app doesn’t! So I stopped using the other editing app and used this one."
5,olivepizza38,This app was so easy to use and it has no watermark! I also love how it has so many sound affects and transitions.Unlike some apps it doesn’t make the video blurry and choppy when you add a lot of layers. Also it’s free! I would highly recommend (especially if you make edits)
3,M@squerade,"I've used this app for 3 months now and it's a wonder! I love this app, recently while I was editing, I couldn't import a video, I googled it, nothing, searched on YouTube, nothing, so what can I do?? I don't wanna give up on this app since it's my go-to editor but help"
5,No Name08,"PEOPLE, HONESTLY. THIS IS THE BEST EDITING APP IVE EVER USED. ITS FREE AND EASY TO USE, I LOVE IT. IMO ITS EASY TO LEARN AB ALL THE EFFECTS AND ANIMATIONS, IVE HAD THIS FOR JUST TWO DAYS AND IVE GOTTEN SO FAR. WANT PROOF? TIK TOK: @sqr4hh YOULL SEE. THIS IS AN AMAZING APAPPAPSPWKJAKSKSK."
5,jjjjjhjhgzyg,🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🤍😄🤍😛
4,WEIRDLYNORMAL,It’s a great app and very very useful for me to edit my videos for YouTube but when I try to use the effects it says internet connection but I’m connected to the internet but it won’t let me use the effects this has been going on for like 2 weeks now it’s kinda annoying is this a bug or is something with my internet may I get a response of this please
4,HadleyPlays,Are use this app for a lot of my YouTube videos and videos in general but then when I try to make a video that could be 10 minutes or more at the two minute mark it just stopped working it would never let me in so I start using iMovie to merge all of us together with the audio sounded terrible with all the different songs in the starts of them I have the developer Sees this and makes it where it doesn’t crash every single time a video is at least over 30 seconds for me I don’t know it’s going on I’ve deleted all my other videos that I’ve made on it and I might have to delete the app and re-download it sadly but I hope this gets fixed soon because I love this app and it’s help me out so much  Also my channel is HadleyPlays If you wanna watch it
5,papiuwu,This is the best editing app i’ve ever had.I usually don’t make complex edits because i don’t know how but this makes it easy and the transitions are great.Tysm!!❤️
5,makup ellla princess,If I could give the creator 1000000$ I honestly would Bc it’s so free the other editing apps you have to pay like 8$ a month I love the greater!!!
5,jessie1234576890101000,I live this app cause it only shows it water mark at the end and I can put music for free and not get copyrighted!! Btw YouTube is kvyla sorry for self promo ;-;
5,elPekka,I swear thanks to this app I’ve learned so much! I reached 1k subscribers on YouTube thanks to this app! It has everything!  But I’ve been wanting a camera jitter down or up transition when you split  It would make the app much more fun!
5,Ex-sell,"I had to understand a silent tutorial video which had no cursor.  “How to configure an Android Launcher’s animated transitions”?  Not a chance.  Every time a button was pushed, I needed to backup the video and insert notes before the button push.  I needed to know which buttons were being pushed, and when, and why.  But how?  I spent about five whole days seeking an app that would let me add text and pointers to an MP4.   When I found out what CapCut could do, I felt like Lawrence of Arabia coming out of the desert.  Not only could I add text, but I could spin, slide, fade, color, resize, mirror, stylize, animate, and I did not even check on the audio possibilities!  I also did not max out on file size or duration.  And check this out: I did not read any instructions.  Boom!  Game ball, son.  You need to realize how golden CapCut is.  I couldn’t believe how mercenary the rest of the video editing world is.  The sheer Gordon Gekko level of gratuitous greed is astonishing.  Almost everyone wants that download first!  No cost estimates, no package prices; just nonspecific subscriptions with hard time frames and cancellation warnings.  “Buy a year of something from us!  We’ll tell you what you bought AFTER you download and pay.”  But that’s NOT how CapCut treats you.  I clicked once to start with my video, and softly fell into a soothing cloud of  possibilities on a timeline.  After all I had seen, I was still skeptical.  But my project kept getting more flexible and accommodating, until I simply forgot to be cynical about the final product.  I was having a good time doing tedious work.  CapCut is like an Italian restaurant that gives you everything you want and more, and then tears up the check!  What?  That’s right, babe!!  CapCut wears a cape!  It’s a superhero with extra garlic bread!  Okay; maybe CapCut isn’t the best app out there.  But after five days and nights of searching and studying, when I found CapCut, I found more than I was looking for.  Many thanks to the CapCut crew!  My project came out a smooth success, and I have you to thank for it."
5,amazing app keep going,This app really helps me 100/100% I love this app it’s very helpful for people who need help on things it’s free and the overlays are great and this is such a good app but on video star I have to pay for a lot of things while this app removes watermarkes and other stuff  for free this app  is good for edits but I also use video star but  this app is WAY easier also could u pls add more other translations I’m not asking u to be like video star but I’d also be nice if u add more translations for people to use overall this app is a good app and it’s not really for computer it’s mainly for iPhone which is great but I also wish this app is also great for  other devices that don’t have iPhones or iPads :D
4,vbtntby,I love the app it’s great and is easy to use.But I don’t like it when you put music or something else in besides the actual video it gets quite. It’s annoying because then I have to go change the volume of all the clips. And it would also be helpful if when you change the volume it would say add to all clips so you don’t have to keep changing the volume to each and every clip. You could just change the volume on one clip and it does it all the clips but besides that I love the app great job 👏🏾
5,Luisito lol,This is the best editing app I’ve ever used! But one thing I don’t like is when my YouTube videos could be 20 minutes long but I have to cut parts to be 15 minutes and k don’t like that :/ could you guys please fix this :)
4,xXChopstickXx,This app is amazing and I love the effects but recently it has been acting strange. It keeps telling me to connect to the internet but I already am. I was on YouTube a few minutes ago and it still says to connect to the internet. I can see the internet bars are there and they are full. This has never happened to any other apps so I think this is a problem with cap cut and not my internet.
5,nicks review app,this app is the best editing app that I have ever used in my life. I’m a YouTube or and I’m always looking for good apps to edit my videos with. I’m so glad that I came across this. It’s so good that I’m literally surprised that you don’t have to pay for not one feature in this app. It’s amazing and I would recommend it to anybody. There’s just so much possibilities that you can do with this app and it’s absolutely amazing
1,fsbtgkbg,It’s not fair- it works perfectly for my friend but for me it says I have bad connection? NO I DONT UGH IM SO MAD if you worked I would have gave 5 stars but I guess u didn’t want it >:(
4,Flamingo#2,Its a good app i edit alot for tiktok and youtube so it looks great but sometimes when im trying to add a photo it will just but nothing there like a have 0 pictures and sometimes when im trying to get in the app it just kicks me out for no reason
3,Savannah5510,"9/13/2020— Effects won’t show and I can’t download any new effects because of “no internet connection” and a video got all the effects locked and I can’t fix prior effects... please fix this...  8/28/2020 First of all I love the variety of effects could be used, add the audio effects are useful as well. It is a very good versatility to the app and it’s definitely worth the download. Using animations is a game changer too.  I will add though...I wish that the effects could also be applied as a overlay, and have the opacity adjustable.  Additionally, I would love it if users could bookmark/favorite certain effects into a folder to speed up editing time."
5,Despacito spider newbie noob,"I love this app it’s amazing and I love how I get to make my own edits, but, none of the stuff it loading for me at the moment while all my other stuff it working like YouTube and etc. it says I have no connection like with internet but I do since all my other stuff is working."
5,SMH I GOT SAD,YAS👏🏻QWEEN👏🏻GET👏🏻INTO👏🏻IT
5,Natalie-Kenner-🤗,"It’s really easy to edit with and has really improved my editing skills, but my friends and I have been looking to start a YouTube channel, and this app only fits phones. If there was a way to make the screens for computers as well, that would make it way better!"
5,jfcutbendkdiNdjzjx7285937274,I have been using this app for a while and this is THE best editing app out there. I use it for editing my YouTube and other videos. And they keep adding new features. But I do ask if they could put like a fish eye feature or something like that. But even without that this is the best editing app out there.
5,AngeryBird:),If your like me and aspire to make good YouTube content then this is the app. Although it’s like really good no watermark and completely free I want you guys to add a feature where you can select all clips and move it wherever you want easily because the problem I have right now is that I had forgot a clip to put in the beginning and now I already have every effect and text in its place so when I manually move all the clips it’s take even longer to sync everything back up again just to put in a 3 second clip just because you forgot. And so now your either gonna have to start all over or your going to just completely give up. I hope you read this honestly. This would really change my day if you did do this. So whoever reads this that’s from the cap cut team please forward this to the head of the company to make this possible or something so I can have fun again and not worry if I have enough clips😁thanks for reading and I usually don’t write reviews but this is one I needed to do so.
4,Jarvie H,I’ve been using CapCut since I saw a ad on Instagram . I’m going to be brief but I would like to know when exporting a video what’s e best frame rate to export because my videos looks like low quality on YouTube and that isn’t very good . Help ?!?
5,Mudkip808,I love the app personally cause it is useful when it comes too most type of media like say social platforms like YouTube or Instagram and can be used just to better improve personal videos.  Also that Evan if sometimes it will crash your progress will be saved.  Suggestion: I work on different types of videos and would love if you could add a “Blur In” and a “Blur Out” transition or animations cause it would fit well with the many other animations.
5,ITS ME I WIN U LOSE HAHA,Ive been using this app when only 9 people had it now 910 people have it i use this too edit my YouTube videos and tik tok videos dont change this app its the bestty
4,iiAsheGames,This app is very great for video editing and making with effects but one problem is about the time amount max you get.The max is 15 mins but if I’m making a video longer than 15 mins and spent a lot of time editing it it won’t export so I kinda suggest making the time amount at least 2 hours or shorter that way we can have a longer video :)
1,oops tey again deer,I would recommend the app for personal videos but if you plan to do YouTube it isn’t clear if you could monetize  the videos and if you can’t I don’t see a purpose of the app. Tried to contact the company several times and nothing so I might uninstall.  PLEASE RESPOND!!!!
4,hiimasheep,"This app is great and I use it often for montages. I would rate it 5 stars if it had a separate tool to order the images and videos, because currently it is very tedious to move everything into the order I want. It would also be great if I was able to use my music from Spotify in my projects."
4,RizzleJJ,I have used this app for many different videos on my YouTube channel and it’s been great! One thing I have a problem with is that when I want to watch the video it gets all glitchy and impossible to watch. Other than that this is a great app!
5,cnbchcmcmdm,This is the best app ever now I can post my YouTube videos without buying music five stars and it’s also free
5,elizabethhernandezcool,This app is good I used it in my android before and now I have a iPhone and it is till good I love this app so much
5,agent 72 Kaylie,"It never glitches once for me. I uploaded YouTube videos with it, it combines the videos together perfectly, you can add different sounds and change the volume do photos and videos. There is so many transitions and all of them for free. It might take some time to upload 20 minute videos but it’s worth it. You can also overlay things which can be very cool for short videos. I LOVE IT!"
5,MetaChrist,"This is the best video freakin’ video fx editing app on the marketplace today hands down and it’s FREE!   I can’t express in words how stoked I am to have discovered this app hiding among the heap of garbage masquerading as video effects editing applications that don’t give you 1/10 of the feature that come FREE with CapCut.   Seriously, the sheer amount of features, options and functions included with this  app blows my mind and it’s ALL FREE! No bs paywalls for the good stuff. This app is also user friendly and the user interface is so intuitive that you can dive right into it and instantly get to creating some really neat stuff.     Did I mention that All is this comes FREE; Effects, frames, stickers, sound effects, music, canvas formatting, resolution up to 4k, color, contrast hue, saturation adjustment etc as well as the ability to import your own iTunes tracks and if that’s not enough you can even extract/rip audio tracks from other videos to get around the DRM issues with iTunes if you really need a song, you ca also record voiceovers, they have even included pitch shifting and audio speed controls. You get all of this without any bullsh*t subscription/service fees or predatory weekly, monthly or annual subscription fees. You get everything but the kitchen sink with CapCut.   This is some seriously kick ass software developed by pros who know what videographers, film makers and artists want in their video editing applications. And to make this app even that much more appealing they even have free updates where they add new filters, features, sound effects, stickers, animations etc. you name it.   Oh and if you’re a TikTok user they allow you to post direct to TikTok.   I LOVE THIS APP! For examples of what it can do check out some of my procreate time lapse videos I’ve made using the app @ 13lack Mass on YouTube.  Thanks to the devs at CapCut! I’m officially in love with you and this app!!!! Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU! -13"
5,FallingNebula17,"I’ve been looked bf for a great editing app for like ever.everytime I get one, there’s always a cache to it.Not this one folks, this one is literally perfect!I don’t even write reviews, but here I am, cause it’s THAT GOOD. Thank u for an AMAZING app!😁✌️"
5,darieshmelle,I love capcut so much cause EVERYTHING is free and it’s just like editing with video star and works on Iphone and android it has everything a pro editor would use. some people even say ever since I started using Capcut my edits have been sooo GOOD and because of this app I got called talented!! I just wanna say Thank you to the creators of Capcut 10000/10 do recommend you won’t regret
5,Anonymous-10198,I’m not a bot you can find my edit account @yeumiio on Instagram. This app is so easy and straightforward it takes a bit to figure things out but I love it with videostar you have to pay for certain effects but not with this everything is free with no watermarks I love it 🥺💕💕 definitely recommend ❤️❤️❤️
5,Mr Jack17,Honestly I have been looking for a free video editor for my YouTube channel and CapCut is just that. This app can seriously compete with big video editing franchises and the best part it is completely free to use.
5,Deisha_K,"I can’t even put this app into words...it’s just that amazing so simply and well organized, I didn’t believe it at first but when I started using it I fell in love.All I have to say is thank to who ever created this app you are a genius.. anyway great app you guys should totally download it"
5,prettygirl.katrell,So I never wanted to start a YouTube channel but I found this app and I said yes this is the one!!!!i love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️
5,Jazz_muri120,"Okay... listen Im not a person who leaves reviews on apps, I’m usually the person who goes to the most critical reviews cuz that’s where you get more info if the app really works or not and honestly...this app rocks. I edit videos and all the transitions and cool stuff are all free and there great:) the outcome of the videos are great.Plus you can insert your music ;) for free like if you wanted to extract a sound from your camera roll you can. 100% recommend this app 🤗"
5,jaeden rodriquez,Awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome
5,SMR Head,My New Go to app👌🏾
4,no beacause no,This app is really good for pro and beginners but I’m very confused why the things load very slow also for example I’m trying to use auto velocity and it takes a long time to load
5,eater of chipotle,"I love this app and I use it for my YouTube videos! But, I wish I was able to record on the app. Other than that, it’s an awesome app and I recommend it for YouTubers!"
5,fight_forlive,This takes alot of gigabytes in just a few days of using it but other than that it’s really useful and actually FUN to use
5,souligh,It’s good because you could add a lots of good and nice videos and it makes them look so so cool
1,destroyervoidboi73657264827,"I used to like using the app until recently every time I make an edit it never is timed, I triple check if it’s time right and it is but when I save it it doesn’t work fix this stupid and just use literally any other app besides this one if your a beginner"
3,idkkkkjkkkkkkkkk,I love this app it’s so easy to use and it makes wonderful videos! But it lets me reverse for awhile then it says “couldn’t reverse try again” and it’s making me really mad. I’ve waited 2 days to see if it would work again and it doesn’t.
5,RB123🥳,"It’s an amazing video editor with no further comments!!! Make sure to watch the tutorials on it if you are new, which can be found IN the app!"
5,niqueluvalways💯,Capcut is so cool and u can get your edit done fast and it will be fun
